description: Update CLAUDE.md with session learnings and maintain context
---

You are being asked to update the CLAUDE.md file at the end of a session to maintain continuity for future Claude instances.

## Your Task

1. **Review the current session** and identify:
   - New documentation files created
   - User preferences or patterns that emerged
   - Technical decisions or approaches taken
   - Any new conventions established
   - Topics or technologies discussed

2. **Read the current CLAUDE.md** to understand existing context

3. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - New files in the repository structure section
   - Updated user preferences (append, don't remove old ones unless contradictory)
   - New patterns or conventions discovered
   - Any important technical decisions or approaches
   - Relevant context that future instances should know

4. **Keep updates concise** - only add information that:
   - Helps future instances be more productive
   - Captures user preferences and patterns
   - Documents important architectural or technical decisions
   - Isn't obvious from reading the files themselves

5. **Format consistently** with the existing CLAUDE.md structure

## What to Include

✅ **Do include:**
- New files and their purposes
- User's preferred documentation style
- Technical approaches that worked well
- Patterns in how user asks questions
- Important context about the repository's purpose
- Decisions about tools, frameworks, or approaches

❌ **Don't include:**
- Trivial session details
- Temporary file paths
- One-off commands that aren't patterns
- Information that's already in the files themselves
- Obvious information

## Example Update

If user created several security-focused documentation files, you might add:
- Update repository structure with new files
- Note user's focus on security and legal considerations
- Document preference for comprehensive guides with alternatives
- Add any new documentation standards that emerged

After updating, provide a brief summary of changes made to CLAUDE.md.
