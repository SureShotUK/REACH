## Safest Option: Use Your Phone's Hotspot

**🚨 CRITICAL:** Turn OFF WiFi on your phone when using it as a hotspot (use cellular data only)

**Why:** Cellular hotspot is significantly more secure than public WiFi

---

## If You Must Use Public WiFi

### Before Connecting
- Ask staff for the official network name
- Watch for fake "evil twin" networks with similar names

### Essential Security
- Use a VPN (gives best protection by encrypting all traffic)
- Verify network name with staff before connecting
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all important accounts
- Keep all devices and apps updated
- Only visit HTTPS websites (padlock icon in address bar)

### Device Settings
- **💻 Laptop:** Set network to "Public" profile (select "No" for discoverability)
- **📱 iOS:** Enable "Private Address" for WiFi networks
- **📱 Android:** Enable "Use randomized MAC" for WiFi networks

## What NEVER to Do

- Banking or financial transactions
- Shopping with credit cards
- Accessing work systems
- Leave device unattended
- Accept file transfers from unknown devices
- Connect without verifying network name

---

## Physical Security

- Position screen away from others
- Lock screen when stepping away
- Keep device physically close to you
- Turn off Bluetooth when not in use
- Be aware of surroundings

---

## When Finished

- Disconnect from WiFi
- "Forget" the network to prevent auto-reconnect

---

## Remember

**❌ Common Myths:**
- HTTPS alone is NOT enough protection
- Reputable locations do NOT have safe WiFi
- Password-protected public WiFi is NOT secure
- Mobile devices are NOT automatically secure

**✅ Key Takeaway:** Use your phone's cellular hotspot whenever possible. If you must use public WiFi, verify the network name and use a VPN.
