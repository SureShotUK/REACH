## ONE-TIME SETUP (Do These Once)

### Essential Security Setup

- [ ] **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on all accounts
  - Email (Gmail, Outlook)
  - Office 365 and work accounts
  - Cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox)
  - Banking and financial accounts
  - Use authenticator app (Microsoft/Google Authenticator) - more secure than SMS

- [ ] **Install a Password Manager** (choose one)
  - 1Password, Bitwarden, NordPass, or Proton Pass
  - Create strong, unique passwords for every account
  - Never reuse passwords

- [ ] **Consider Installing a VPN** (recommended for maximum security)
  - NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, or Proton VPN
  - Avoid free VPNs (they may sell your data)

### Configure Windows Security

- [ ] **Set automatic screen lock**
  - Settings > Personalization > Lock screen > Screen saver settings
  - Set wait time: 2-5 minutes
  - Check "On resume, display logon screen"

- [ ] **Practice the manual lock shortcut: Windows Key + L**
  - Use every time you step away from your laptop

- [ ] **Disable WiFi auto-connect for public networks**
  - Settings > Network & Internet > WiFi > Manage known networks
  - Uncheck "Connect automatically" for coffee shops, airports, etc.

## EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT TO PUBLIC WIFI

### Before Connecting

- [ ] **Ask staff for the official WiFi network name**
  - Don't guess or assume
  - Watch for fake networks with similar names ("Starbucks_WiFi" vs "Starbucks_Free_WiFi")

- [ ] **Verify your laptop is charged or you have your charger**

### When Connecting

- [ ] **Select "No" when Windows asks about discoverability**
  - This sets the network to "Public" (safer setting)
  - Hides your computer from other devices on the network

- [ ] **If you have a VPN: Launch it and connect**
  - Wait for "Connected" confirmation
  - Verify connection at https://www.whatismyip.com

### While Working on Public WiFi

#### Digital Security

- [ ] **Keep your VPN connected** (if you have one)

- [ ] **Only visit websites with HTTPS (padlock icon in address bar)**
  - Look for `https://` at the start of web addresses
  - Avoid websites that show "Not Secure"

- [ ] **Lock your screen when stepping away (Windows Key + L)**

#### Physical Security

- [ ] **Position your screen away from others' view**
  - Sit with your back to a wall when possible
  - Tilt screen away from open areas

- [ ] **Keep your laptop close to your body**
  - Don't leave it unattended, even for a moment

- [ ] **Be aware of your surroundings**
  - Watch for people trying to view your screen
  - Shield your keyboard when typing passwords

### What NOT to Do on Public WiFi

**Never do these without a VPN:**
- [ ] ❌ Banking or financial transactions
- [ ] ❌ Accessing work systems (email, intranet, cloud apps)
- [ ] ❌ Shopping or entering credit card information

## EMERGENCY SHORTCUTS

## IF YOU FEEL UNSAFE

**Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong:**

1. Disconnect from the WiFi immediately
2. Close your laptop
3. Move to a different location or leave
4. Use your mobile hotspot instead (tether to your phone)
5. Or wait until you're on a trusted network (home/office)

**Alternative to Public WiFi:**
- Use your phone's mobile hotspot (more secure than public WiFi)
- Wait and work offline, sync files later

## REMEMBER

**Security Priority Order:**

1. **Verify the network name** - Always ask staff
2. **Set network to "Public"** - Choose "No" when Windows asks
3. **Use MFA on all accounts** - Protects even if password is stolen
4. **Use strong, unique passwords** - Let your password manager handle this
6. **Use a VPN if possible** - Best protection for public WiFi
7. **Only visit HTTPS websites** - Look for the padlock icon

**Physical Security:**
- Lock your screen when away (Windows Key + L)
- Position your screen away from others
- Keep your laptop close at all times
- Be aware of your surroundings
