### Barmby Moor, Pocklington, England

**Document Date:** 29 October 2025
**Assessment Type:** Water Discharge Activity Permit Requirements
**Site Location:** Near Barmby Moor, Pocklington, East Yorkshire
**Activity:** Discharge of reverse osmosis concentrate to unnamed land drain

---

## Executive Summary

**Permit Required:** YES - Environmental Permit for Water Discharge Activity required under Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.

**Permit Type:** Likely **Bespoke Permit** due to daily discharge volume and site sensitivities.

**Key Findings:**
- Discharge of 35,000 L/day RO concentrate to surface water requires an Environmental Permit
- No applicable exemptions for this discharge volume and type
- Bespoke permit recommended due to:
  - Discharge volume (35m³/day exceeds typical standard rules thresholds)
  - Unnamed watercourse (requires detailed impact assessment)
  - Potential proximity to protected sites
  - Laboratory/pharmaceutical sector (higher scrutiny on chemical constituents)
- Pre-application advice from EA strongly recommended
- Application timeline: 4-6 months minimum for determination
- Estimated total project cost: £15,000-£35,000 (application + testing + potential treatment)

---

## 1. PERMIT REQUIREMENT DETERMINATION

### 1.1 Legal Framework

The discharge is regulated under:

- **Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016** (as amended)
- **Schedule 21, Part 1**: Water Discharge Activities
- **Water Resources Act 1991, Section 85**: Prohibition on polluting controlled waters

**Regulatory Position:** Any discharge of trade effluent or process water to surface water, groundwater, or coastal water requires an Environmental Permit unless specifically exempted.

### 1.2 Is a Permit Required?

**YES - Environmental Permit Required**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Controlled Waters**: An unnamed land drain is classified as "inland freshwater" under the Water Resources Act 1991, making it controlled water
2. **Trade/Process Discharge**: RO concentrate from a laboratory/pharmaceutical operation is not domestic sewage and constitutes a trade effluent discharge
3. **Volume**: 35,000 L/day (35 m³/day) is a material discharge volume requiring regulation
4. **Pollutant Potential**: RO concentrate contains elevated dissolved solids, salts, and potentially rejected contaminants from feed water
5. **No Exemption Applies**: No exemptions under Schedule 3 of EPR 2016 cover this discharge type

**Legal Consequence of Unlicensed Discharge:**
Discharging without a permit is a criminal offence under s.12 EPR 2016 and s.85 Water Resources Act 1991. Penalties include:
- Unlimited fines on conviction
- Potential imprisonment for serious/persistent offences
- Enforcement action including prohibition notices

### 1.3 Exemption Assessment

**Checked Exemptions - None Applicable:**

| Exemption | Description | Applicable? | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| EX1 | Small sewage discharges (≤5m³/day domestic) | NO | Not domestic sewage; volume >5m³ |
| EX2 | Uncontaminated water discharges | NO | RO concentrate has elevated TDS/salts |
| EX3 | Specified cooling water discharges | NO | Not cooling water |
| EX4 | Single dwelling sewage ≤5 persons | NO | Not domestic; commercial operation |
| Schedule 3, Para 3 | Temporary dewatering | NO | Continuous operational discharge |

**Conclusion:** No exemptions available. Full Environmental Permit required.

### 1.4 Permit Type: Standard Rules vs Bespoke

**Assessment:**

**Standard Rules Permits** (SR2015 series for water discharges):
- Pre-defined conditions and limits
- Lower application cost
- Faster determination (typically 13 weeks)
- Suitable for low-risk, well-characterized discharges

**Common Standard Rules for Process Effluent:**
- **SR2015 No. 12**: Small sewage discharge to surface water (≤5m³/day) - **Not suitable** (volume too high)
- **SR2015 No. 13-14**: Various surface water discharges - **Requires review** but unlikely suitable due to:
  - Unnamed watercourse (standard rules typically require named watercourses)
  - Volume exceeds typical standard rules thresholds
  - Laboratory/pharmaceutical sector may have specific contaminant concerns

**Recommendation: BESPOKE PERMIT**

**Justification:**
1. **Discharge Volume**: 35m³/day exceeds standard rules thresholds for most categories
2. **Receiving Watercourse**: Unnamed land drain requires site-specific dilution assessment and impact modeling
3. **Sector Risk Profile**: Laboratory/pharmaceutical operations require detailed chemical characterization due to potential for complex chemical species in wastewater
4. **Potential Site Sensitivities**: Proximity to protected sites requires detailed environmental risk assessment
5. **Flexibility**: Bespoke permit allows tailored conditions matching actual site operations and environmental risk

**Note:** During pre-application discussions, EA may confirm if any standard rules permit could apply, but bespoke is most likely outcome.

**Pharmaceutical/Laboratory-Specific Concerns:**

Given the laboratory/pharmaceutical sector, **additional scrutiny required** for:

1. **Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)**: Even trace concentrations can trigger environmental concerns
2. **Cleaning Agents**: Laboratory cleaning chemicals (acids, bases, detergents, disinfectants)
3. **Biological Materials**: Any biological contaminants from laboratory activities
4. **Specialized Chemicals**: Research chemicals, reagents, culture media

**Critical Action:** Provide EA with comprehensive inventory of:
- All chemicals used on site
- Waste disposal procedures
- Spill containment measures
- Drainage segregation arrangements

**RO Concentrate Characteristics - Expected Values:**

For RO system with **65% recovery** (35% reject):
- **TDS concentration factor**: ~2.86x feed water
- **Typical mains water TDS**: 150-400 mg/L
- **Expected concentrate TDS**: 430-1,150 mg/L
- **Chloride**: Feed 40-80 mg/L → Concentrate 115-230 mg/L
- **Conductivity**: Feed 300-600 µS/cm → Concentrate 860-1,720 µS/cm

**Cost Estimate - RO Concentrate Testing:**
- Initial comprehensive characterization (all parameters): £3,500-£6,000
- Trial period monitoring (12 weeks, weekly sampling): £4,000-£7,000
- Pharmaceutical screening (API/organics): £2,000-£5,000 (sector-specific)
- **Total: £9,500-£18,000**

### 2.3 Mixing Zone and Dilution Assessment

**Requirement:** Demonstrate that discharge meets Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) at defined mixing zone boundary.

**Modeling Required:**
- **Dilution calculation**: Based on receiving water flow and discharge volume
- **Mixing zone assessment**: Distance/area where initial mixing occurs
- **EQS compliance demonstration**: Show that EQS met at edge of mixing zone

**Key Parameters:**
- Chloride (250 mg/L chronic EQS for freshwater protection)
- pH (6-9 for most freshwaters)
- Specific pollutants if detected (metals, pharmaceuticals)

**Worst-Case Scenario Modeling:**
- Assume **Q95 flow** (flow exceeded 95% of the time - low flow) in receiving drain
- Unnamed land drain: Likely very low flow (possibly <10 L/s)
- **Critical Issue**: Low flow in receiving drain may provide insufficient dilution

**Preliminary Dilution Assessment:**

| Scenario | Receiving Water Flow | Discharge Flow | Dilution Factor | Concentrate TDS (800 mg/L) | Mixed TDS |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Worst case | 2 L/s (173 m³/day) | 35 m³/day (0.4 L/s) | 5:1 | 800 mg/L | ~660 mg/L |
| Moderate | 5 L/s (432 m³/day) | 35 m³/day (0.4 L/s) | 12:1 | 800 mg/L | ~485 mg/L |
| Good | 10 L/s (864 m³/day) | 35 m³/day (0.4 L/s) | 25:1 | 800 mg/L | ~375 mg/L |

**Potential Issue:** If unnamed drain has very low base flow (<2 L/s), insufficient dilution may be a **significant consent barrier**.

**Cost Estimate - Mixing Assessment:**
- Flow monitoring (low-cost datalogger, 4-12 weeks): £1,000-£2,500
- Dilution modeling and technical report: £2,000-£4,000
- **Total: £3,000-£6,500**

### 2.4 Required Monitoring Frequency (Post-Permit)

**Typical Permit Conditions:**

| Parameter | Monitoring Frequency | Reporting Frequency |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| pH | Continuous or daily spot check | Monthly return |
| Flow/Volume | Continuous totalizer or daily reading | Monthly return |
| Electrical Conductivity | Weekly | Monthly return |
| Chloride | Monthly | Monthly return |
| Suspended Solids | Monthly | Monthly return |
| Specific contaminants (if found) | As specified in permit | As specified |
| Annual comprehensive suite | Annually | Annual return |

**Cost Estimate - Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Annual monitoring and analysis: £3,000-£6,000/year
- Subsistence charge (see Section 5): £1,221-£6,833/year depending on categorization

## 3. TREATMENT/PROCESSING NEEDS

### 3.1 RO Concentrate Characteristics Requiring Treatment

**Primary Concerns:**

1. **Elevated Salinity/TDS**: 2.5-3x concentration of feed water dissolved solids
2. **pH Variation**: RO concentrate may have pH shift depending on feed water chemistry
3. **Chloride Concentration**: Primary environmental concern for freshwater ecosystems
4. **Intermittent Flow**: Batch discharge may cause shock loading to receiving water

### 3.2 Likely Discharge Consent Conditions

**Typical Permit Limits for Surface Water Discharge:**

| Parameter | Likely Limit Range | Basis | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| **pH** | 6.0 - 9.0 | Standard for freshwater protection | Must maintain within range at all times |
| **Temperature** | Ambient +3°C or <25°C | Prevent thermal impact | RO concentrate typically near ambient |
| **Chloride** | 250-500 mg/L | EQS compliance; site-specific | May be tighter if baseline chloride already elevated |
| **TDS/Conductivity** | Site-specific | Based on receiving water baseline | May have mass load limit (kg/day) |
| **Flow rate** | Max 0.4 L/s (35 m³/day) | Volumetric control | May require flow smoothing |
| **Suspended Solids** | 30-50 mg/L | General effluent standard | Should be low for RO concentrate |
| **BOD₅** | 20-40 mg/L | Oxygen demand control | Should be very low for RO concentrate |
| **Metals** | EQS compliance | WFD priority substances | Depends on characterization results |
| **Specific contaminants** | Determined by risk assessment | Pharmaceutical APIs, lab chemicals | Critical for pharmaceutical sector |

**Operational Conditions:**
- **No Visible Oil or Grease**: Visual check requirement
- **No Abnormal Colour**: Aesthetic condition
- **No Trade Effluent other than RO Concentrate**: Drainage segregation requirement
- **Spillage Prevention**: Bunded storage, spill kits, emergency procedures

### 3.3 Treatment System Requirements

**Assessment Based on Feed Water = Potable Mains Supply:**

**Likely Treatment Needs: MINIMAL TO MODERATE**

**Scenario A: Potable Water Feed (No Contamination)**

If RO feed is exclusively clean mains potable water with no process contamination:

**Required Treatment:**
1. **pH Adjustment (if needed)**
   - **System**: Acid/alkali dosing with pH control
   - **Cost**: £3,000-£8,000 installed
   - **Operating**: £500-£1,500/year (chemicals + maintenance)
   - **Requirement**: Only if concentrate pH falls outside 6-9 range

2. **Flow Balancing/Attenuation**
   - **System**: Balance tank (5,000-10,000L) with controlled discharge pump
   - **Purpose**: Smooth batch discharge, prevent shock loading to drain
   - **Cost**: £5,000-£15,000 (tank, pump, controls)
   - **Benefit**: Reduces peak flow, improves mixing in receiving water

3. **Dilution/Blending** (if chloride limit issue)
   - **System**: Blend concentrate with clean water (rainwater harvesting, additional mains)
   - **Cost**: Variable; £2,000-£10,000 depending on approach
   - **Feasibility**: May not be economically viable vs. alternative discharge

**Scenario B: Contaminated Feed Path Risk**

If there's potential for laboratory/pharmaceutical process water to enter RO feed (contaminated mains supply through on-site plumbing):

**Required Treatment:**
1. **All Scenario A treatments**, PLUS:

2. **Pre-treatment of RO Feed**
   - **Activated Carbon Filter**: Remove organic compounds
   - **Cost**: £5,000-£15,000 installed
   - **Operating**: £1,500-£3,000/year

3. **Monitoring/Detection**
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: pH, conductivity, possibly TOC
   - **Cost**: £10,000-£25,000 for multi-parameter system
   - **Operating**: £2,000-£4,000/year maintenance

4. **Contamination Prevention**
   - **Drainage Segregation**: Separate drains for process vs. RO feed
   - **Backflow Prevention**: Double-check valves on mains connection
   - **Spill Containment**: Bunded areas, spill kits
   - **Cost**: £5,000-£20,000 depending on site complexity

### 3.4 Alternative Discharge Routes

**If surface water discharge proves problematic**, consider:

**Option 1: Discharge to Foul Sewer**
- **Requirement**: Trade effluent consent from Yorkshire Water (local sewerage undertaker)
- **Advantages**:
  - May have higher salinity acceptance
  - Wastewater treatment works provide additional treatment
  - Less stringent ecological standards
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Trade effluent charges (could be significant for volume)
  - Still requires consent process
  - Chloride may still be an issue for WWTW
- **Cost**: Trade effluent charges typically £1-3/m³ = £12,775-£38,325/year for 35m³/day

**Option 2: Tankered Removal**
- **Advantage**: No discharge consent needed
- **Disadvantage**: Very expensive for 35m³/day
- **Cost**: Estimated £50-100/m³ collected = £639,000-£1,278,000/year (**Not viable**)

**Option 3: On-site Re-use/Evaporation**
- **Applications**: Irrigation, dust suppression, toilet flushing, cooling
- **Feasibility**: Limited by site needs; pharmaceutical lab may have limited re-use options
- **Cost**: Variable; £10,000-£50,000 for re-use plumbing

**Option 4: Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)**
- **Technology**: Evaporator/crystallizer to eliminate discharge
- **Capital Cost**: £100,000-£300,000+
- **Operating Cost**: High energy consumption
- **Feasibility**: Only for high-value applications or extreme regulatory constraints

**Recommendation:** Pursue surface water discharge with appropriate treatment/controls. If EA indicates unacceptable impact, negotiate foul sewer discharge as backup.

### 4.3 Site-Specific Assessments

**Water Framework Directive (WFD) Assessment:**

**Requirement:** Demonstrate discharge will not cause deterioration of waterbody status.

**WFD Waterbody Identification:**
- Use EA's Catchment Data Explorer (https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/)
- Identify WFD waterbody that unnamed drain feeds into
- Determine current ecological and chemical status
- Assess protected areas (Drinking Water Protected Area, Habitats Directive sites, etc.)

**Barmby Moor Area Context:**
- **River Basin District**: Humber
- **Likely catchment**: River Derwent or Pocklington Canal catchment
- **Protected sites in area**: Lower Derwent Valley SAC/SPA/Ramsar (~8-10 km north), Pocklington Canal SSSI

**WFD Assessment Requirements:**
- **No deterioration**: Demonstrate discharge won't cause any WFD quality element to deteriorate to lower status class
- **No prevention of objectives**: Show discharge won't prevent waterbody achieving Good status
- **Protected areas**: Confirm no impact on downstream protected sites

**Assessment Approach:**
1. Identify all relevant WFD quality elements (biological, chemical, physicochemical)
2. Compare discharge constituents to Environmental Quality Standards (EQS)
3. Model dilution and demonstrate compliance at edge of mixing zone
4. Assess cumulative impacts (other discharges, abstractions in catchment)

**Ecological Assessment:**

**For unnamed land drain, consider:**
- **Flow regime**: Agricultural drains often seasonal/ephemeral; may dry up in summer
- **Ecological value**: Likely limited for very small drain; may increase downstream
- **Connectivity**: Does drain support fish passage? Connectivity to higher-value watercourses?
- **Macroinvertebrates**: Baseline survey recommended to establish existing community

**If drain connects to higher-value watercourses:**
- **Downstream impacts**: Model dilution and attenuation downstream
- **Fisheries**: Assess chloride toxicity to sensitive species (salmonids if Derwent connection)
- **Habitats**: Protected wetland habitats (Lower Derwent Valley) sensitive to salinity changes

**Hydrogeological Assessment:**

**Groundwater Connection Consideration:**
- Agricultural drains may have permeable base (groundwater interaction)
- If groundwater connection, may trigger **groundwater discharge activity** permit requirements
- **Assessment**: Review BGS geology maps, check for aquifer presence

**Area Geology (Barmby Moor):**
- Likely superficial deposits over Mercia Mudstone or Sherwood Sandstone
- Sherwood Sandstone is Principal Aquifer if present
- Check for Source Protection Zones (SPZs) - nearby Pocklington groundwater sources possible

**If Principal Aquifer present:**
- May require groundwater impact assessment
- Chloride is conservative pollutant (no degradation) - long-term accumulation concern
- EA particularly sensitive to groundwater contamination risks

**Action:** Check EA's "What's In Your Backyard" map for aquifer designation and SPZs.

**Protected Sites Assessment:**

**Nearby Designations:**
- **Lower Derwent Valley** (8-10 km north): SAC, SPA, Ramsar, SSSI
  - Designated for wetland habitats, breeding/wintering birds, floodplain ecology
  - **Hydrological connection?** Assess if site drains ultimately reach Derwent system
  - **Salinity sensitivity**: Wetland habitats highly sensitive to salinity increases

- **Pocklington Canal** (3-4 km south): SSSI
  - Designated for aquatic plants, invertebrates
  - **Hydrological connection?** Unlikely direct connection but verify

**Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA):**

**If hydrological connection to Lower Derwent Valley SAC/SPA:**
- **Screening required**: Assess Likely Significant Effects (LSE)
- **Potential impact pathways**:
  - Increased salinity affecting wetland vegetation
  - Water quality changes affecting invertebrate communities
  - Flow regime changes
- **Mitigation**: May require enhanced treatment or discharge restrictions
- **Process**: EA will consult Natural England
- **Timeline impact**: HRA can add 3-6 months to determination

**Recommendation:** Early identification of hydrological pathways and consultation with EA pre-app team critical.

## 5. COST ESTIMATES

### 5.1 Environment Agency Application Fee

**Bespoke Water Discharge Activity Permit Application Fees:**

| Permit Type | Application Fee | Basis |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Standard process (low complexity)** | £1,550 | Straightforward discharge, no protected sites, clear BAT |
| **Standard process (medium complexity)** | £8,100 | Requires detailed assessment, modeling, or site visit |
| **Standard process (high complexity)** | £16,200 | Complex site, protected sites, detailed HRA, extensive consultation |
| **ADDITIONAL - Advertising** | £0-£500 | If public consultation required (EA decision) |

**Assessment for This Application:**

**Likely Fee: £8,100 (Medium Complexity)**

**Justification:**
- Discharge volume and site require detailed assessment (not simple low-risk discharge)
- Unnamed receiving watercourse requires dilution modeling
- Potential protected site proximity requires screening
- Pharmaceutical sector requires additional scrutiny
- **However**: Not highest complexity unless HRA Appropriate Assessment required

**If Habitats Regulations Appropriate Assessment required:** Fee increases to £16,200

**Payment:** Fee must accompany application. Not refundable if application withdrawn or refused.

### 5.2 Annual Subsistence Charge

**Subsistence charges fund ongoing EA regulatory activities** (compliance monitoring, site inspections, permit variations).

**Charging Scheme:** Based on Operator Risk Appraisal (OPRA) - scores environmental risk and operator performance.

**OPRA Scoring:**
- **Environmental Risk:** Complexity, hazard, size of discharge
- **Operator Performance:** Compliance record, management systems, complaints

**Subsistence Bands for Water Discharge Activities:**

| Band | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Small** | £308 | £612 | £1,221 |
| **Medium** | £816 | £1,631 | £3,262 |
| **Large** | £3,417 | £6,833 | £13,667 |

**Size Assessment for 35 m³/day Discharge:**

**Likely: SMALL or MEDIUM**

- **Small band**: <25 m³/day OR <50 m³/day if low environmental impact
- **Medium band**: 25-250 m³/day
- **Large band**: >250 m³/day

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Environmental hazard**: Medium (salinity impact, unnamed watercourse)
- **Operator performance**: Initially medium (new operator); improves with good compliance record
- **Likely band**: **Medium risk, Small-Medium size**

**Estimated Annual Subsistence: £612-£3,262**

**Conservative estimate for budgeting: £1,631/year**

**Note:** Subsistence charge billed annually. Good compliance record can reduce charge over time.

### 5.7 Alternative: Foul Sewer Discharge Cost Comparison

**If surface water discharge proves difficult**, foul sewer discharge alternative:

| Cost Element | One-Time Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Trade effluent consent application (Yorkshire Water) | £500-£1,500 | - |
| Sampling and characterization | £2,000-£5,000 | - |
| Connection to foul sewer (if distant) | £5,000-£20,000 | - |
| Trade effluent charges (£1-3/m³, 35m³/day, 250 days/year) | - | £8,750-£26,250 |
| Annual consent monitoring | - | £1,000-£2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **£7,500-£26,500** | **£9,750-£28,250/year** |

**Assessment:** Foul sewer has lower capital cost but significantly higher ongoing cost. Only viable if:
- Surface water discharge refused or impractical
- Yorkshire Water accepts discharge (not guaranteed - chloride may be issue)
- Site has access to foul sewer (may not be available in rural location)

---

## 6. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 6.1 Application Timeline

**Pre-Application Phase: 2-6 months**
- Pre-application meeting with EA (2-4 weeks to arrange, 1-2 meetings)
- Baseline monitoring (minimum 3 months for seasonal variation)
- RO concentrate trial monitoring (3 months recommended)
- Report writing and application preparation (1-2 months)

**Application Phase:**

| Stage | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Application submission** | - | Submit with full fee |
| **EA validation (duly made check)** | 20 working days | EA reviews completeness; may request additional information |
| **Determination period - Standard** | 13 weeks | Starts after validation; for standard process applications |
| **Determination period - Non-standard** | 4 months | If complex/public consultation required |
| **Consultation period** (if required) | 4-8 weeks | EA determines if consultation needed; runs within determination period |
| **Additional information requests** | Variable | Stops determination clock until information provided |
| **Natural England consultation** (if HRA) | 21 days - 6 months | Can significantly extend timeline if HRA required |

**Best Case Timeline:** 6-9 months (pre-app to permit issue)
**Typical Timeline:** 9-12 months
**Complex Case (HRA):** 12-18 months

**Critical Path Items:**
1. **Baseline monitoring**: Cannot be rushed; seasonal variation important
2. **Pre-app advice**: Early engagement reduces downstream delays
3. **HRA screening**: If protected site issues identified, start early consultation with Natural England

**Recommendations:**
- Start baseline monitoring immediately (even before pre-app meeting)
- Run RO trial monitoring in parallel to gather discharge data
- Submit complete, high-quality application to avoid validation delays
- Budget for consultant support to avoid information requests during determination

### 6.2 Consultation Requirements

**EA Decision:** EA determines if consultation required based on environmental risk and public interest.

**Consultation Triggers:**
- Discharges to watercourses supporting high ecological value
- Protected sites potentially affected
- Public water supply abstractions downstream
- Previous public concerns about water quality in area
- Discharge to watercourse with existing quality issues

**Consultation Bodies (if required):**
- **Natural England**: If European/national designated sites potentially affected (MANDATORY if LSE identified)
- **Local Planning Authority**: Pocklington Town Council, East Riding of Yorkshire Council
- **Internal Drainage Board**: If relevant IDB area
- **Public Water Supply Companies**: Yorkshire Water if abstractions downstream
- **Angling/Conservation Groups**: If fisheries or ecology concerns
- **Public Notice**: Published on EA website, potentially local press

**Your Site - Consultation Likelihood:**

**Moderate to High Probability** due to:
- Proximity to Lower Derwent Valley protected sites
- Unnamed watercourse (limited existing characterization)
- Pharmaceutical sector (public interest in chemical discharges)

**If Consultation Required:**
- EA publishes application details on Public Register
- 20-28 day consultation period
- EA considers all representations received
- May result in tighter permit conditions or mitigation requirements

**Proactive Stakeholder Engagement:**

**Consider voluntary pre-application engagement:**
- **Natural England**: If hydrological connection to protected sites possible
- **Yorkshire Wildlife Trust**: Local conservation perspective
- **Angling groups**: If downstream fisheries (Derwent system)
- **Local parish council**: Community liaison

**Benefits:**
- Identify concerns early
- Build support or address objections before application
- Demonstrate good corporate citizenship
- May reduce formal consultation issues

### 6.3 Site-Specific Considerations - Barmby Moor/Pocklington Area

**Local Environmental Context:**

**Hydrology:**
- Area drains to River Derwent catchment (likely northern drainage) or Market Weighton Canal/Pocklington Canal system (southern drainage)
- Flat, low-lying agricultural land with extensive field drainage systems
- Many unnamed agricultural drains and ditches (receiving water characterization critical)
- Seasonal flow variation in minor watercourses (summer low flows, winter spates)

**Geology and Hydrogeology:**
- Likely superficial clay/till deposits over Mercia Mudstone (secondary aquifer) or Sherwood Sandstone (principal aquifer if present)
- Check for aquifer designation and Source Protection Zones
- Agricultural drains may have groundwater connectivity in permeable deposits

**Environmental Sensitivities:**

**Lower Derwent Valley (8-10 km north):**
- **Designation**: SAC, SPA, Ramsar, multiple SSSIs
- **Features**: Largest area of species-rich, traditionally managed floodplain grassland in UK
- **Sensitivities**: Hydrology, water quality, salinity extremely important
- **Hydrological connection**: Determine if site drains (even indirectly) to Derwent system
- **Impact**: If connected, very high scrutiny; likely HRA Appropriate Assessment required

**Pocklington Canal SSSI (3-4 km south):**
- **Designation**: SSSI for aquatic habitats and species
- **Hydrology**: Canal hydrologically isolated but check for any connections
- **Impact**: Lower concern unless direct hydrological pathway

**Agricultural Land:**
- Intensive arable agriculture in area
- Existing nutrient loading to watercourses from agricultural runoff
- Water quality in minor drains may already be degraded (baseline characterization important)

**Water Framework Directive Waterbodies:**

**Identify relevant WFD waterbody:**
- Use EA Catchment Data Explorer: https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/
- **Likely**: "Pocklington Beck" or "East Riding Becks" WFD waterbody
- Check current ecological and chemical status
- Review Reasons for Not Achieving Good (RNAG) - existing pressures

**Existing WFD Issues in Area:**
- Many East Yorkshire watercourses have nutrient pollution (agriculture)
- Flow modification (land drainage)
- Chemical status often affected by legacy pollutants or pesticides

**WFD Implications:**
- If waterbody already failing for salinity/chloride: May face extra scrutiny
- If waterbody at Good status: Must not cause deterioration
- Cumulative assessment: Consider other discharges and abstractions

**Local EA Office:**

**Area Team:** Environment Agency - Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Area
- **Office**: Depends on catchment; likely Leeds or Hull office cover area
- **Engagement**: Early contact with local permitting team recommended
- **Local knowledge**: EA area staff understand local watercourse issues and protected sites

**Planning Context:**

- Check if RO system requires planning permission (industrial/lab building extension, external tanks)
- East Riding of Yorkshire Council planning authority
- Coordinate EA permit with any planning application
- Note: EA permit does NOT grant planning permission; separate process

**Utilities:**

**Yorkshire Water:**
- Mains water supplier (RO feed)
- Sewerage undertaker (if foul sewer discharge considered)
- Check trade effluent consent requirements if sewer option explored

**Access to Sewer:**
- Rural location: May be limited or no foul sewer availability
- Nearest sewer connection could be significant distance (1-2+ km possible)
- Connection cost could be prohibitive if sewer distant

### 6.4 Risk Factors and Potential Issues

**High Risk Issues - Could Prevent or Delay Consent:**

1. **Insufficient Dilution in Receiving Watercourse**
   - **Problem**: Unnamed drain has very low base flow (<2 L/s) providing inadequate dilution for chloride/TDS
   - **Consequence**: Cannot meet EQS at edge of mixing zone
   - **Mitigation Options**:
     - Reduce discharge chloride/TDS (dilution/blending at source)
     - Store and discharge only during higher flow periods (winter) - may not be acceptable
     - Alternative discharge route (foul sewer, different watercourse)
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate - unnamed drains often have poor dilution capacity

2. **Hydrological Connection to Lower Derwent Valley Protected Sites**
   - **Problem**: Site drains to Derwent system, requiring HRA Appropriate Assessment
   - **Consequence**: Extended timeline, significant mitigation potentially required, possible refusal
   - **Mitigation Options**:
     - Enhanced treatment to eliminate risk
     - Detailed salinity impact modeling showing negligible effect
     - Alternative discharge location/route
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate to High if northern drainage confirmed

3. **Pharmaceutical Contaminants in RO Concentrate**
   - **Problem**: API residues, lab chemicals, or other complex organics concentrated in reject stream
   - **Consequence**: Unable to meet EQS for specific substances; potential environmental hazard
   - **Mitigation Options**:
     - Strict drainage segregation (prevent contamination of RO feed)
     - Pre-treatment of RO feed (activated carbon, etc.)
     - Post-treatment of concentrate
     - Demonstrate contamination pathway cannot occur
   - **Likelihood**: Low if strict procedures in place; Moderate if drainage not segregated

4. **Groundwater Contamination Risk**
   - **Problem**: Receiving drain has permeable base; discharge infiltrates to principal aquifer or SPZ
   - **Consequence**: Requires groundwater discharge activity permit; very difficult to obtain for polluting discharges
   - **Mitigation Options**:
     - Demonstrate no significant infiltration (lined drain, clay base)
     - Alternative discharge point to lined channel
     - Accept requirement for dual water discharge + groundwater activity permit
   - **Likelihood**: Low to Moderate depending on site-specific hydrogeology

**Medium Risk Issues - May Require Additional Work or Mitigation:**

5. **WFD Deterioration Risk**
   - **Problem**: Discharge could cause WFD quality element to drop to lower status class
   - **Consequence**: Additional assessment required, possibly enhanced treatment or monitoring
   - **Mitigation**: Detailed WFD assessment, demonstrate no measurable impact on status

6. **Ecological Impact - Chloride Toxicity**
   - **Problem**: Chloride concentrations exceed chronic EQS (250 mg/L) at edge of mixing zone
   - **Consequence**: Ecological harm to sensitive invertebrates or fish
   - **Mitigation**: Dilution/blending, discharge timing controls, enhanced mixing

7. **Consultation Objections**
   - **Problem**: Natural England, conservation groups, or public object to discharge
   - **Consequence**: EA must address objections; may result in permit refusal or onerous conditions
   - **Mitigation**: Proactive stakeholder engagement, robust environmental assessment, transparency

**Low Risk Issues - Unlikely to Prevent Consent but Need Addressing:**

8. **pH Variation**: RO concentrate pH slightly outside 6-9 range - easily mitigated with dosing
9. **Flow regime change**: Intermittent batch discharge causes hydrological change - mitigated with balancing tank
10. **Monitoring compliance**: Operator unable to maintain monitoring schedule - plan for outsourced sampling

### 6.5 Proactive Risk Management Strategies

**Strategy 1: Early Identification of Deal-Breakers**

**Action Plan:**
1. **Immediate**: Use EA's online tools to identify WFD waterbody, protected sites, SPZs
2. **Within 2 weeks**: Schedule pre-application meeting with EA to discuss:
   - Receiving watercourse adequacy
   - Protected site screening
   - Permit route and feasibility
3. **Within 1 month**: Commission basic flow survey of unnamed drain (low-cost 2-4 week flow monitoring)
4. **Decision Point**: If fundamental issues identified (no dilution capacity, direct protected site impact), consider alternative discharge options BEFORE investing heavily in full application

**Strategy 2: Parallel Path Planning**

**Prepare alternative discharge options in parallel:**

**Option A** (Primary): Surface water discharge to unnamed drain
- Full permit application as outlined
- Baseline monitoring and characterization

**Option B** (Backup): Foul sewer discharge
- Early contact with Yorkshire Water trade effluent team
- Confirm sewer availability and capacity
- Understand trade effluent charges and consent requirements
- **Trigger**: Surface water EA pre-app feedback identifies major obstacles

**Option C** (Contingency): Alternative surface water discharge point
- Identify larger watercourse with better dilution capacity (if within reasonable distance)
- May require pipework extension but could avoid application refusal
- **Trigger**: Unnamed drain dilution capacity insufficient

**Strategy 3: Robust Application First Time**

**Avoid "information request" delays:**
- Use experienced environmental consultant to prepare application
- Include comprehensive supporting documents
- Over-communicate potential issues and mitigation
- High-quality figures, maps, and data presentation
- Independent peer review before submission

**Benefits:**
- Faster determination
- Demonstrates competence to EA (better OPRA score)
- Reduces risk of refusal

**Strategy 4: Community and Stakeholder Liaison**

**Proactive engagement:**
- Contact parish council to explain project
- Engage local environmental groups (Yorkshire Wildlife Trust)
- If relevant, discuss with local farmers/landowners (receiving drain may cross their land)
- Transparency: Offer to share monitoring data, site visit for interested parties

**Benefits:**
- Builds trust and social license
- Early warning of concerns
- Potential allies if consultation occurs

## 8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Summary of Permit Requirement

**Definitive Answer: YES, Environmental Permit Required**

The discharge of 35,000 L/day of reverse osmosis concentrate to an unnamed land drain constitutes a Water Discharge Activity under Schedule 21 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016. An Environmental Permit is **legally required** before discharge can commence. No exemptions apply to this discharge type and volume.

**Permit Type: Bespoke (almost certain)**

Due to discharge volume, unnamed receiving watercourse, pharmaceutical sector, and potential environmental sensitivities, a bespoke permit application is recommended. Standard rules permits are unlikely to be suitable for this discharge.

### 8.2 Key Findings

**Viable But Complex:**
The discharge is likely to be **permittable** subject to:
- Adequate dilution in receiving watercourse (critical uncertainty)
- Comprehensive characterization showing no unacceptable contaminants (pharmaceutical sector scrutiny)
- Demonstration of WFD compliance (no deterioration)
- Protected sites screening (Lower Derwent Valley proximity)

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Receiving watercourse dilution capacity**: If unnamed drain has very low base flow, this is primary constraint
2. **Pharmaceutical contamination prevention**: Drainage segregation and operating procedures essential
3. **Protected sites pathway**: If hydrological connection to Lower Derwent Valley, HRA will be required
4. **Early EA engagement**: Pre-application advice strongly recommended to identify issues early

**Primary Risk:** Insufficient dilution in small unnamed drain during low flow conditions may prevent consent or require alternative discharge route.

### 8.3 Recommended Pathway Forward

**Immediate Priority: Feasibility Confirmation**

**DO NOT proceed with full application investment until:**
1. EA pre-application feedback confirms feasible pathway
2. Preliminary flow monitoring indicates adequate dilution capacity
3. Protected sites hydrological pathway assessed
4. Budget confirmed

**Estimated timeline to permit: 9-12 months minimum** (feasibility to permit issue)

**Estimated total capital cost: £60,000-£100,000** (typical scenario)

**Estimated annual operating cost: £7,000-£15,000** (monitoring + subsistence + treatment operation)

### 8.4 Alternative Options Assessment

**If surface water discharge problematic:**

**Option A: Foul Sewer Discharge to Yorkshire Water**
- Lower capital cost (£7,500-£26,500)
- Higher annual cost (£9,750-£28,250/year trade effluent charges)
- Depends on sewer availability (may not be available in rural location)
- Yorkshire Water may not accept high chloride discharge

**Option B: On-site Re-use of RO Concentrate**
- Explore uses: Irrigation, dust suppression, toilet flushing, cleaning
- Reduces discharge volume, potentially eliminating permit need if sufficient re-use
- Capital cost variable (£10,000-£50,000 for re-use infrastructure)
- Limited applicability for pharmaceutical laboratory

**Option C: Blend/Dilute at Source**
- Mix concentrate with additional clean water to reduce TDS/chloride before discharge
- Increases overall discharge volume but reduces pollutant concentration
- May improve EQS compliance
- Increases mains water consumption cost

**Option D: Seasonal/Controlled Discharge**
- Store concentrate, discharge only during high flow periods
- Requires large storage tank
- May not be acceptable to EA (prefer continuous low discharge over intermittent high discharge)
- Risk management issues (tank overflow, long storage periods)

**Recommendation:** Pursue surface water discharge as primary option with foul sewer as backup. Explore partial concentrate re-use to reduce discharge volume if viable.

### 8.5 Critical Action Plan (Next 30 Days)

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Contact EA for pre-application advice appointment (03708 506 506)
- [ ] Commission preliminary flow monitoring of unnamed drain (environmental consultant or use in-house equipment)
- [ ] Desktop study: EA Catchment Data Explorer, What's In Your Backyard, Magic Map
- [ ] Walk site and receiving watercourse, document drainage pathway

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Contact Yorkshire Water trade effluent team for foul sewer alternative feasibility
- [ ] Prepare site information pack for EA pre-app meeting (site location, process description, initial water balance)
- [ ] Request quotes from 2-3 environmental consultants for application support

**Week 3:**
- [ ] Attend EA pre-application meeting (if arranged)
- [ ] Review pre-app feedback and assess feasibility
- [ ] Select environmental consultant (if proceeding)
- [ ] Develop project budget and timeline

**Week 4:**
- [ ] GO/NO-GO decision point
- [ ] If GO: Initiate baseline monitoring program and RO trial characterization
- [ ] If NO-GO: Pursue foul sewer option or alternative approaches

**Beyond Week 4:**
- Follow Phase 2-6 action plan (Section 6.6) if proceeding

### 8.6 Final Recommendations

**Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Early EA Engagement is CRITICAL**: Do not invest heavily in baseline monitoring or application preparation without EA pre-application advice. £2,000-£3,000 for pre-app advice can save £20,000+ in abortive work.

2. **Flow Monitoring First**: Conduct quick preliminary flow assessment (4 weeks, £1,000-£1,500) BEFORE committing to full baseline program. If dilution capacity inadequate, surface water discharge not viable.

3. **Pharmaceutical Drainage Segregation**: Ensure absolute segregation of laboratory/pharmaceutical process drainage from RO feed water. Contamination of concentrate with pharmaceutical substances will significantly complicate or prevent consent.

4. **Professional Support**: This is a complex application. Use experienced environmental consultant with water discharge permit and EA liaison experience. False economy to cut corners on professional support.

5. **Protected Sites Screening Early**: Determine hydrological connection to Lower Derwent Valley SAC/SPA immediately. If connected, HRA will dominate timeline and cost. Budget and plan accordingly.

6. **Parallel Path Planning**: Develop foul sewer discharge alternative in parallel during feasibility phase. If surface water proves unviable, pivot quickly to sewer option without losing momentum.

7. **Budget Conservatively**: Use upper end of cost ranges for budgeting. Environmental permitting always has uncertainty and potential for additional work.

8. **Timeline Realism**: 9-12 months typical timeline. Do not plan operational RO system reliant on discharge consent in <9 months from starting permit process.

**Technical Recommendations:**

9. **Treatment System Design**: Budget for flow balancing tank and pH adjustment as minimum. Allows operational flexibility and demonstrates BAT to EA.

10. **Monitoring Equipment**: Install continuous pH and flow monitoring from day one. Demonstrates compliance commitment and provides defense if any issues arise.

11. **Management Systems**: Develop robust operating procedures, monitoring schedules, and emergency response plans. Good management system improves OPRA score (lower subsistence charges).

12. **Data Quality**: Use UKAS-accredited laboratories for all testing. Poor quality data will be rejected by EA, causing delays and re-work.

**Regulatory Recommendations:**

13. **WFD Compliance**: Invest in thorough WFD assessment. This is non-negotiable requirement; EA will refuse permit if WFD compliance not demonstrated.

14. **Baseline Variability**: Conduct baseline monitoring across seasons and flow conditions. Limited data will be criticized; comprehensive baseline demonstrates due diligence.

15. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Consider proactive engagement with Natural England (if protected sites relevant) and local conservation groups. Building support or addressing concerns pre-application reduces consultation risks.

**Commercial Recommendations:**

16. **Lifecycle Cost Analysis**: Evaluate capital vs. operating costs for different options. Foul sewer has lower capital but high ongoing costs. Surface water has high capital but low ongoing. Decision depends on business timeframe and cash flow.

17. **Contingency Planning**: Have operational contingency if permit delayed. Can RO system operate at reduced capacity with tankered disposal temporarily? Can operations continue without RO water?

18. **Future Proofing**: If business may expand, consider applying for higher discharge volume limit now (if sustainable). Permit variations later add cost and time.
