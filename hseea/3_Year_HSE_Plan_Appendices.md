**When External Specialist Support Is Needed:**
- **Occupational Health:** If health surveillance becomes necessary
- **Occupational Hygiene:** If exposure monitoring required for chemical dusts/vapours
- **Structural Engineering:** For racking inspections (SEMA approved inspectors required annually)
- **Environmental Specialist:** Complex effluent treatment, permit applications, EA / Water company engagement
- **Fire Risk Assessment:** Specialist fire risk assessor for comprehensive FRA review

- Training for users of access equipment
- Inspection of ladders every 6 months, record if used commercially

#### Racking Safety
- Annual SEMA-approved racking inspection (legal requirement under PUWER if damage could cause collapse)
