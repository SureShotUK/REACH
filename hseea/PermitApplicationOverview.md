# Permit Application Overview
## RO Concentrate Discharge to Surface Water
### Environmental Sensitivity and Cost Assessment

**Document Date:** 30 October 2025
**Site Location:** Near Barmby Moor, Pocklington, East Yorkshire
**Discharge Point Grid Reference:** SE 78168 47996
**Receiving Watercourse:** Unnamed agricultural drain (River Derwent catchment)

---

## Environmental Context

The grid reference SE 78168 47996 (the outfall of the drain) is in the catchment of the **River Derwent**. This is a highly sensitive environmental area:

- The Derwent is a designated **Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)**
- The Derwent is a **Special Area of Conservation (SAC)** due to its important wildlife
- Our site is within a designated **Impact Risk Zone** for the SSSI

### Regulatory Implications

This designation means:

**Level of Scrutiny:** The Environment Agency (EA) scrutiny will be extremely high. Their primary goal will be to protect this sensitive site, so our application must be flawless.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:** The penalties would be severe:
- Criminal prosecution in the higher courts
- Potential for unlimited fines and up to 5 years imprisonment
- Recent fines for water companies have reached tens of millions of pounds
- EA can impose a stop notice requiring immediate cessation of discharge
- Failure to comply with a stop notice is a criminal offence with further penalties

### EA Perspective on RO Concentrate

The reverse osmosis (RO) process concentrates substances already present in potable water (chlorine, salts, minerals). Discharging this high-salinity, potentially chlorinated water into a small stream is the EA's primary concern, as it can be toxic to aquatic life.

**Our application will need to focus on proving we can manage these concentrated substances.**

## 1. Estimated Permit Application Fees

The SSSI status does not affect the fee payable for a permit. The fee structure is based on the type of discharge and its volume, not the sensitivity of the location. Fee calculations based on Table 1.3.11-12 in EA document LIT 17156:

| Daily Discharge Volume (L/day) | Daily Discharge Volume (m³/day) | Base Application Charge | Additional Assessments* | Total Estimated Application Fee |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,000 | 2 | £3,940 | + £6,870 | **£10,810** |
| 5,000 | 5 | £3,940 | + £6,870 | **£10,810** |
| 10,000 | 10 | £7,829 | + £6,870 | **£14,700** |
| 20,000 | 20 | £7,829 | + £6,870 | **£14,700** |
| 35,000 | 35 | £7,829 | + £6,870 | **£14,700** |
| 50,000 | 50 | £7,829 | + £6,870 | **£14,700** |

### Additional Assessments Breakdown

## 2. Precautions & Testing

Our focus must be on proving we can manage the concentration and timing of the discharge.

### 2.1 Key Precautions (Treatment Plan)

#### 1. De-chlorination (Critical Priority)

**Status:** Highest priority

The RO process concentrates the chlorine from mains water, which is highly toxic to aquatic life in the SSSI.

**Requirement:** Install an effective de-chlorination system (e.g., activated carbon filter) on the concentrate line.

#### 2. Buffer Tank & Controlled Release (Core of Application)

**Status:** Essential requirement

You cannot simply discharge intermittent flow directly.

**Requirements:**
- Holding tank to store the concentrate
- System fitted with pump or valve on a timer
- Slowly bleeds concentrate into stream over 24-hour period
- Ensures stream's natural flow can dilute concentrate even when operations are not running

#### 3. TDS / Salinity Management (Main Challenge)

**Status:** Primary concern

The concentrate will be high-salinity 'brine' compared to the freshwater stream. Our entire application rests on proving that even after controlled release (precaution #2), the final mixed concentration in the stream is safe.

### 2.2 Required Testing (Evidence)

We need to gather data to build a "mass balance" calculation to prove to the EA that the discharge is safe.

#### Baseline Stream Analysis (Essential)

We must commission a water quality survey of the stream, critically including:

**Low Flow Data:**
- Stream's flow rate during dry period ("Q95" flow)
- This is the EA's worst-case scenario for dilution

**Baseline Chemistry:**
- Existing (upstream) conductivity/TDS
- pH
- Temperature

#### Effluent Analysis (Simplified)

Because we use no chemicals, this is simpler:

- Chemical analysis of incoming mains water (from water authority)
- Chemical analysis of final RO concentrate
- This allows us to state: "The concentrate contains only X, Y, and Z, which are present in the original mains water, at 3× concentration"

#### De-chlorination Proof

Must test water after de-chlorination system to prove:
- Total Residual Oxidant (TRO) level is below detection limit
- Or at safe level (e.g., <0.01 mg/L)

---

## 3. Key Unknowns

The success of the permit now rests on one critical unknown:

### The Stream's Dilution Capacity

**This is the single biggest risk to the project.**

We know the discharge volume is 15,634 litres/day (approximately 15.6 m³/day). But:

- **If** the small stream's low-flow rate is only 50,000-80,000 litres/day, there may not be enough water to dilute the concentrate safely, and the EA will likely refuse the permit (dilution ratio of only 3:1 to 5:1)
- **If** the stream's flow is 150,000-200,000 litres/day or higher, we have a reasonable case (dilution ratio of 10:1 to 13:1)
- **If** the stream's flow exceeds 500,000 litres/day, we have a very strong case (dilution ratio >30:1)

**This unknown must be resolved through professional flow assessment before significant investment in the application.**

## 4. Environmental Testing – Getting a Consultant

### 4.1 Define the Service You Need

When contacting potential consultants, be clear about the scope of work. We need more than just raw data; we need a **full assessment and report suitable for submitting to the EA**.

Key services to request:

#### Hydrometric Survey / Flow Gauging
- Specifically to determine stream's low-flow statistics (Q95)
- Ask how they plan to establish this (site visits during dry periods, correlation with EA data)

#### Water Quality Sampling & Analysis
- **Baseline:** Upstream of proposed discharge point
- **Effluent:** Analysis of RO concentrate after de-chlorination

#### Discharge Impact Assessment / Mixing Zone Analysis
- Core report using flow and quality data
- Model how discharge mixes in stream
- Predict concentration of key parameters (especially conductivity/TDS and residual chlorine) downstream
- Assess against relevant Environmental Quality Standards (EQS)

#### H1 Environmental Risk Assessment
- EA's standard format for assessing risks
- Consultant should complete as part of application support

#### Permit Application Support
- Ideally, consultant should compile technical parts of permit application
- Using the data gathered

- Projects where they have successfully obtained discharge permits from EA
- Especially for discharges into sensitive environments like SSSIs or SACs

#### Accreditation
- Ensure laboratory they use is **UKAS accredited** for specific parameters being tested (conductivity, chlorine, etc.)
- Check if consultancy is registered with CIWEM or CIEEM
- Verify they employ Chartered members (MCIWEM, CEnv, CEcol)

#### Scope of Service
- Confirm they will produce full impact assessment report
- Help prepare permit application, not just provide raw data

#### Local Knowledge (Advantageous)
- Firm familiar with River Derwent catchment and local EA office
- May navigate process more smoothly

#### Cost vs. Value
- Get quotes from 2-3 firms
- Don't just pick the cheapest
- Consider experience and thoroughness of proposed methodology
- **Weak assessment report will likely lead to permit refusal**

---

### 4.4 Briefing the Consultant for a Quote

To get an accurate quote, provide potential consultants with:

**Project Description:**
- Discharge of RO concentrate (no added chemicals)
- Treating mains water

**Location:**
- Exact grid reference (SE 78168 47996)
- Small stream in River Derwent SSSI/SAC catchment

**Discharge Details:**
- Daily volume: 15,634 litres/day (15.6 m³/day)
- Intermittent nature (8 hours/day, approx. 5 days/week, 250 days/year)

**Your Aim:**
- Obtain Bespoke Environmental Permit for the discharge

**Required Services:**
- List key services from above (flow gauging, water quality, impact assessment, permit support)

This level of detail helps them understand complexity (especially due to SSSI/SAC) and provide realistic quote and timeline.

## 7. Summary of Key Risks

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Stream Dilution Capacity:** The unknown flow rate of the receiving stream is the single biggest risk. If flow is insufficient, permit will likely be refused.

2. **SSSI/SAC Protection:** Given the highly sensitive receiving environment, the application must be exceptionally thorough and demonstrate no adverse impact on designated features.

3. **Chlorine Management:** De-chlorination system must be proven effective to prevent toxic discharge to aquatic life.

4. **Salinity Impact:** Must demonstrate that concentrated salts/TDS will be adequately diluted after mixing.

### Risk Mitigation

- Commission professional hydrometric survey early to assess feasibility
- Use experienced consultant with proven SSSI/SAC permit experience
- Install robust de-chlorination system with continuous monitoring
- Implement buffer tank with controlled release to manage discharge timing
- Prepare for Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) requirement
- Budget conservatively for potential additional requirements
