## 1. Legal Framework

<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/917/regulation/3/made" target="_blank">Regulation 3 of the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981</a> places a duty on employers to provide, or ensure are provided:

- equipment and facilities that are adequate and appropriate for enabling first aid to be rendered to employees who are injured or become ill at work; and
- a sufficient number of suitable persons, with appropriate training and qualifications, to render first aid.

HSE guidance on these requirements is set out in *First aid at work: The Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 – Guidance on Regulations* (L74, Third Edition, reissued with minor amendments 2024). This assessment applies the needs assessment framework set out in L74.

> "Employers have a legal duty to make arrangements to ensure their employees receive immediate attention if they are injured or taken ill at work." [L74, para 3]

## 3. First Aid Needs Assessment

"An employer should make an assessment of first-aid needs appropriate to the circumstances (hazards and risks) of each workplace." [L74, para 4]. This assessment works through the factors set out in Table 1 of L74 [L74, paras 10–11]. L74 additionally requires that where a site contains different work activities with different hazard profiles, "separate risk assessments will have to be made for individual departments, and the results of these should be carried over to the assessment of first-aid needs." [L74, para 16]

### 3.1 Hazards

This is a **mixed-hazard site**. The office is a low-hazard environment. The warehouse is a **higher-hazard** environment, placing the overall site in the higher-hazard category for the purposes of this assessment.

**Warehouse hazards:**

| Hazard | Cause of Accident | Potential Injuries |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Fork lift trucks (FLTs) | Collision with pedestrians, overturning, load instability | Crush injuries, fractures, spinal injuries, head injuries |
| Articulated trucks | Loading/unloading operations, vehicle movement | Crush injuries, falls from height, fractures |
| Manual handling | Loading, unloading, moving materials | Fractures, lacerations, sprains and strains |
| Slip, trip and fall | Wet floors, uneven surfaces | Fractures, lacerations, head injuries |

**Office hazards:**

Low-level hazards only (slips, trips, minor cuts, sudden illness). L74 identifies offices as a typical low-hazard environment [L74, Appendix 3].

**Substance and process:** The substance stored and processed is non-hazardous. The manufacturing process (mixing with water) produces a non-hazardous solution. No chemical first-aid special hazards arise from the substances themselves. However, the physical operations associated with storage and manufacture (FLTs, bulk handling, vehicles) create significant mechanical hazards.

L74 states that where work involves higher-level hazards such as dangerous machinery, "first-aid requirements will be greater" and employers should "provide sufficient numbers of qualified first-aiders so that someone is always available to give first aid immediately following an incident." [L74, para 15]

### 3.2 Number of Employees

The site employs a maximum of 9 people: 3 in the warehouse and up to 6 in the office. L74 notes that "employee numbers should not be the sole basis for determining first-aid needs" [L74, para 19] and that "there is no fixed level, but each employer needs to assess the equipment, facilities and personnel that are appropriate." [L74, para 8]

Applying Appendix 3 to the site as a whole:

- **Hazard category:** Higher hazard (due to FLT and vehicle operations)
- **Employee count:** Up to 9
- **Appendix 3 indicates:** At least **1 EFAW or FAW trained first-aider**, depending on the type of injuries that may occur [L74, Appendix 3]

The type of injuries likely to arise from FLT and vehicle operations (fractures, crush injuries, potential spinal involvement) are directly relevant to the determination of training level (see section 4.3).

### 3.3 Nature of the Workforce

No known health conditions have been identified. However, the physical demands and hazards of warehouse work create an inherently elevated risk of serious injury compared to purely office-based environments. The age profile of the workforce should be kept under review as an indicator of cardiac risk [L74, para 17].

### 3.4 Work Patterns

Working hours are 07:00–17:00, Monday to Friday. There is no shift or out-of-hours working, which simplifies provision: first-aid cover is only required during these fixed hours. L74 requires that "sufficient first-aid equipment, facilities and personnel should be available at all times, taking account of alternative working patterns." [L74, para 4]. Cover for annual leave and unplanned absences of first-aiders remains essential [L74, para 27].

### 3.5 Distribution of the Workforce

The office and warehouse are in **separate buildings** on the same site. L74 requires employers to consider how the layout of premises could affect quick access to first-aid facilities, including "whether additional first-aid provision is needed on a site with more than one building." [L74, para 23]. A first-aider located in the office building cannot be assumed to be immediately accessible to a worker injured in the warehouse, and vice versa. This has a direct bearing on the number of trained first-aiders needed (see section 4.2).

### 3.6 Remoteness from Emergency Medical Services

The site is **13 miles from the nearest hospital**. This is a significant factor. L74 states: "Where a site is remote from emergency medical services, employers may need to make special arrangements to ensure appropriate transport is available. They may also need to consider whether the contents of the first-aid kit are adequate in case there is a delay in the emergency services attending an incident, particularly when working in high-hazard and/or remote environments." [L74, para 24]

Even with an ambulance station 2.3 miles away, a 13-mile distance to hospital means that for serious injuries (such as crush injuries or fractures from FLT incidents), definitive hospital treatment may be significantly delayed. This makes the quality of first aid administered on-site—and therefore the training level of the first-aider—critically important. It argues strongly for a **FAW qualification** rather than EFAW for the primary first-aider covering the warehouse (see section 4.3).

### 3.7 Non-Employees (Visiting Drivers)

Articulated truck drivers sometimes come onto the site on foot during loading and unloading operations. This places them in proximity to FLT and vehicle movements, which are among the highest-risk activities on site. The Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 impose no legal duty to provide first aid for non-employees. However, L74 states: "HSE strongly recommends that you include them in your first-aid provision." [L74, Table 1]. Any first-aid provision made for employees will in practice be available to visiting drivers in an emergency.

Employers should also ensure their liability insurance covers first-aid activities provided to non-employees [L74, para 29].

### 3.8 Lone Working

Occasional lone working is possible, meaning that at times a single employee may be present on site. L74 states: "Where employees work alone, other means of summoning help, such as a mobile phone, may be useful to call for assistance in an emergency." [L74, para 21]. Where a lone worker is in the warehouse, any injury could leave them unable to summon help. Specific procedures should be in place to manage this risk.

It is also important to note that if the lone worker is the trained first-aider, there is no one available to render first aid to that person. This risk should be addressed through lone-working procedures rather than by increasing the number of first-aiders alone.

### 3.9 Accident and Ill-Health History

The site has a good accident and ill-health history with no ill-health reported and accidents result in nothing more serious than a minor cut requiring nothing more than a plaster. There is a low frequency of these low level accidents with only 2 **CHECK THIS BEFORE FINALISING** being reported in the last year. Since investigating the last incident and speaking to the staff about the need to take the proper time and care in all activities there has not been another accident of any type to date.

## 4. Determination of First Aid Personnel Required

### 4.1 Minimum Requirement

Applying the Appendix 3 flow chart [L74, Appendix 3]:

- **Hazard level:** Higher hazard (FLT and articulated truck operations)
- **Employees:** Up to 9 (5–50 bracket)
- **Result:** At least **1 EFAW or FAW trained first-aider**, depending on type of injuries that may occur

"The numbers quoted in Appendix 3 are suggestions only. The employer should take into account all relevant information to make a valid judgement." [L74, para 54]

### 4.2 Recommended Provision

This assessment recommends a **minimum of 2 trained first-aiders** (see training levels in section 4.3), for the following reasons:

1. **Separate buildings:** The office and warehouse are in distinct buildings. A single first-aider based in one building is not readily accessible to workers in the other. L74 requires provision adequate for the site's layout [L74, para 23].

2. **Absence cover:** Adequate provision must be maintained at all times when employees are at work [L74, para 27]. A lone first-aider on annual leave or absent through sickness leaves the site without any trained first-aid cover. Annual leave does not constitute the "exceptional, unforeseen and temporary" absence permitting reliance on an appointed person under Regulation 3(3) [L74, para 81].

3. **Severity of potential injuries and remoteness:** FLT and vehicle incidents can produce serious injuries requiring sustained first-aid management while awaiting emergency services. With the hospital 13 miles away, having only one trained person available on a site of this hazard profile is inadequate [L74, para 24].

4. **Lone working:** Where occasional lone working occurs in the warehouse, there must be clear procedures for that worker to summon help. Having a second trained person available elsewhere on site (or on call during lone working periods) mitigates this risk [L74, para 21].

"There are no standard rules on exact numbers as employers will need to take into account all the relevant circumstances of their particular workplace." [L74, para 53]

### 4.3 Training Level

**Two different training levels are recommended**, reflecting the different hazard profiles of the two areas:

**Warehouse first-aider: FAW (First Aid at Work)**

A full **FAW qualification** is appropriate for the first-aider covering the warehouse, for the following reasons:

- FLT and vehicle incidents can cause injuries to bones, muscles and joints (including suspected spinal injuries), chest injuries, and severe bleeding — all of which are covered in the FAW syllabus (Appendix 5) but not in EFAW
- The 13-mile distance to hospital means there may be a significant interval between an incident and hospital treatment. FAW training equips the first-aider to manage a wider range of injuries during this period
- L74 states that for higher-hazard environments, employers should consider providing first-aiders with training appropriate to the type of injuries that may occur [L74, Appendix 3, column 3]
- The EFAW syllabus covers emergency responses (unconscious casualty, CPR, choking, bleeding, shock, minor injuries) [L74, Appendix 6]. While valuable, it does not cover the management of fractures, spinal injuries, or other injuries likely in FLT incidents, which are covered by FAW [L74, Appendix 5]

**Office first-aider: EFAW (Emergency First Aid at Work)**

An **EFAW qualification** is appropriate for the first-aider based in the office area. The office is a low-hazard environment and EFAW provides adequate emergency first-aid capability. EFAW "enables a first-aider to give emergency first aid to someone who is injured or becomes ill while at work." [L74, Guidance 3]. This person also provides backup cover and absence cover for the FAW-trained first-aider.

### 4.4 Additional Training

Given the combination of higher-hazard vehicle operations and the 13-mile distance to hospital, the employer should consider additional training for the FAW-trained first-aider in the **management of life-threatening bleeding** (application of haemostatic dressings, wound packing, and tourniquets). L74 Appendix 4, Table 3 identifies this training as appropriate for "working locations in remote areas" where vehicle incidents create a risk of severe bleeding requiring intervention before emergency services arrive.

### 4.5 Appointed Person

Where adequate first-aiders are in post, separate appointed persons are not necessary [L74, para 79]. However, a named appointed person should be identified for any periods when both first-aiders are unavailable (e.g. both on annual leave simultaneously), to take charge of first-aid arrangements and call the emergency services. "Appointed persons do not need first-aid training, though they may benefit from completion of an EFAW course (or other suitable alternative)." [L74, para 80]

## 5. Summary of Provision Required

| Provision | Number Required | Training Level |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Warehouse first-aider | **1** | **FAW** |
| Office first-aider | **1** | **EFAW** (minimum) |
| Additional training | Recommended for FAW first-aider | Life-threatening bleeding management (L74, Appendix 4, Table 3) |
| Appointed person | 1 named individual (for cover when both first-aiders absent) | No formal qualification required; EFAW recommended [L74, para 80] |
| First-aid kit | Minimum 1 per building (2 total) | Suitably stocked; consider additional items for higher-hazard warehouse [L74, paras 36–39] |

---

## 6. First Aid Equipment

A minimum of one suitably stocked first-aid container must be provided at each work site [L74, para 36]. Given the two separate buildings, a first-aid container in each building is required. Containers should be easily accessible, preferably near hand-washing facilities, and clearly identified by a white cross on a green background [L74, para 37].

For the **warehouse**, the employer should consider whether the standard first-aid kit contents are sufficient given the higher-hazard operations. L74 Appendix 4, Table 3 suggests that haemostatic dressings and tourniquets may be appropriate where there is a risk of life-threatening bleeding from vehicle-related incidents, particularly given the distance from hospital. Any such items should be stored securely in or near the first-aid container, and access should be restricted to those trained in their use [L74, para 41].

Medicines and tablets should not be kept in the first-aid container. The only exception is aspirin administered in accordance with current first-aid practice for a suspected heart attack [L74, para 42].

---

## 7. Emergency Services Notification

Given the site's distance from the nearest hospital (13 miles) and the presence of significant vehicle hazards, the employer should inform the local ambulance service in writing of:

- The site location
- The nature of activities on site (FLT operations, articulated vehicle movements)
- Any specific hazards or circumstances that could affect emergency response

L74 states that employers should "inform the emergency services, in writing, of their location and any particular circumstances, including specific hazards." [L74, para 24]

---

## 8. Lone Working Procedures

Where any employee is working alone on site, the following provisions should be in place to mitigate the limitations of first-aid provision:

- The lone worker must carry a mobile phone or other means of summoning help [L74, para 21]
- A check-in/check-out procedure should be established so that failure to check in triggers a welfare call
- Consideration should be given to whether lone working in the warehouse (the higher-hazard building) is acceptable, or whether a minimum of two people should always be present during warehouse operations

---

## 9. Information for Employees

<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/917/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">Regulation 4 of the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981</a> requires employers to inform all employees of the arrangements made in connection with first aid, including the location of equipment, facilities, and personnel. At a minimum:

- First-aid notices should be prominently displayed in both the office and warehouse buildings, identifying each first-aider by name, location, and how to contact them
- All employees should be informed of first-aid arrangements during induction [L74, para 83]
- Employees should be made aware of who the appointed person is and how to contact them when first-aiders are absent
- Lone workers must be briefed specifically on the lone working procedures and how to summon emergency help [L74, para 21]

---

## 10. Review

This assessment should be reviewed [L74, para 30]:

- Annually; and
- Following any change in workforce numbers, working patterns, site layout, or activities carried out; or
- Following any accident or incident attended by a first-aider; or
- Following any change in the health status of employees.

All first-aid certificates are valid for **three years** [L74, para 74]. HSE strongly recommends that first-aiders undertake **annual refresher training** during the three-year certification period, although this is not a legal requirement [L74, para 75]. Employers should keep records of first-aiders and certification dates to facilitate timely renewal [L74, para 77].
