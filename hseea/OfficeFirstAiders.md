## 1. Legal Framework

<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/917/regulation/3/made" target="_blank">Regulation 3 of the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981</a> places a duty on employers to provide, or ensure are provided:

- equipment and facilities that are adequate and appropriate for enabling first aid to be rendered to employees who are injured or become ill at work; and
- a sufficient number of suitable persons, with appropriate training and qualifications, to render first aid.

HSE guidance on these requirements is set out in *First aid at work: The Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 – Guidance on Regulations* (L74, Third Edition, reissued with minor amendments 2024). This assessment applies the first-aid needs assessment framework set out in L74.

> "Employers have a legal duty to make arrangements to ensure their employees receive immediate attention if they are injured or taken ill at work." [L74, para 3]

## 3. First Aid Needs Assessment

"An employer should make an assessment of first-aid needs appropriate to the circumstances (hazards and risks) of each workplace." [L74, para 4]. This assessment works through the checklist of factors set out in Table 1 of L74 [L74, paras 10–11].

### 3.1 Hazards

The work is entirely clerical and desk-based. This is a **low-hazard** environment of the kind specifically identified in Appendix 3 of L74 (offices, shops, libraries). The foreseeable hazards include:

- Slips, trips, and falls, including on stairs between the two floors
- Minor cuts from paper or office equipment
- Sudden illness unrelated to work activity (e.g. cardiac events, strokes, diabetic emergencies)

There are no chemicals, dangerous machinery, or other higher-level hazards. L74 notes that "in organisations such as offices or shops, employers may only need to provide an appointed person to take charge of first-aid arrangements, and a clearly identified and suitably stocked first-aid box. However, even in these circumstances it is still possible for an accident or sudden illness to occur and employers may wish to consider having a qualified first-aider available." [L74, p.14]

### 3.2 Number of Employees

The maximum headcount is 25 employees. L74 states: "Where 25 or more people are employed, even in low-hazard environments, at least one such person should be provided." [L74, para 52]. The Appendix 3 guidance table places a low-hazard workplace with 25–50 employees in the category requiring at least one EFAW-trained first-aider [L74, Appendix 3].

Hybrid working means that on any given day, fewer than 25 employees may be on site. L74 notes that "employee numbers should not be the sole basis for determining first-aid needs" [L74, para 19] and that "there is no fixed level, but each employer needs to assess the equipment, facilities and personnel that are appropriate." [L74, para 8]

### 3.3 Nature of the Workforce

One or more members of staff are known to have health conditions. L74 states that "the particular needs of young workers, trainees, pregnant workers and employees with disabilities or particular health problems, where known (eg asthma, diabetes, peanut allergy, epilepsy, mental ill health or a history of heart disease), should be addressed." [L74, para 17]. This increases the likelihood of a medical emergency beyond a minor injury and argues for first-aid provision above the minimum appointed person level.

The 2024 amendments to L74 also emphasise the importance of employers considering employees' mental health when carrying out a first-aid needs assessment [L74, para 6].

### 3.4 Work Patterns

Hybrid working means the number of staff on site varies. L74 requires that "sufficient first-aid equipment, facilities and personnel should be available at all times, taking account of alternative working patterns" [L74, para 4], and that adequate cover must be maintained for annual leave and other planned absences of first-aiders [L74, para 27]. The provision in Regulation 3(3) for an appointed person to stand in for an absent first-aider applies only to "exceptional, unforeseen and temporary circumstances"; absences such as annual leave do not qualify [L74, para 81].

### 3.5 Distribution of the Workforce

The premises are spread across two floors. L74 states that "employers with a multi-floor building should consider how many first-aiders or appointed persons will be required to give adequate provision to employees on each floor." [L74, para 23]

### 3.6 Proximity to Emergency Medical Services

The city centre location provides good access to emergency medical services. L74 identifies remoteness from emergency services as a factor that can require special arrangements [L74, para 24]. City centre proximity is a mitigating factor but does not remove the duty to make adequate first-aid provision.

### 3.7 Non-Employees

Occasional visitors attend the premises. The Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 impose no legal duty to provide first aid for non-employees. However, L74 states: "HSE strongly recommends that you include them in your first-aid provision." [L74, Table 1]. Any provision made for employees will in practice be available to visitors in an emergency.

### 3.8 Accident and Ill-Health History

*[To be completed by the employer based on review of accident records and near-miss reports. First-aid provision should cater for the types of injuries and illnesses that have occurred: L74, para 10, Table 1.]*

## 4. Determination of First Aid Personnel Required

### 4.1 Minimum Requirement

Applying the Appendix 3 flow chart [L74, Appendix 3]:

- **Hazard level:** Low (clerical office, no significant physical hazards)
- **Employees:** 25 (maximum)
- **Result:** At least **1 EFAW-trained first-aider**

"The numbers quoted in Appendix 3 are suggestions only. The employer should take into account all relevant information to make a valid judgement." [L74, para 54]

### 4.2 Recommended Provision

This assessment recommends **2 EFAW-trained first-aiders**, for the following reasons:

1. **Absence cover:** Adequate provision must be maintained at all times when employees are at work [L74, para 27]. Relying on a single first-aider creates periods with no trained cover when that person takes annual leave or is off sick. Annual leave is not the "exceptional, unforeseen and temporary" circumstance that permits reliance on an appointed person under Regulation 3(3) [L74, para 81].

2. **Multi-floor premises:** The two-storey layout means a single first-aider located on one floor may not be immediately accessible to staff on the other floor [L74, para 23].

3. **Hybrid working:** On days when the sole first-aider is working remotely, there would be no trained first-aid cover on site. A second trained person mitigates this risk.

"There are no standard rules on exact numbers as employers will need to take into account all the relevant circumstances of their particular workplace." [L74, para 53]

### 4.3 Training Level: EFAW

**Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW)** is the appropriate training level for this site. EFAW "enables a first-aider to give emergency first aid to someone who is injured or becomes ill while at work" [L74, Guidance 3]. A full **First Aid at Work (FAW)** qualification is not required: Appendix 3 indicates FAW is appropriate for low-hazard workplaces with more than 50 employees. The combination of low hazard, sub-50 employee count, and city centre emergency services access makes EFAW proportionate.

### 4.4 Additional Training

Given that one or more members of staff have known health conditions, the employer should consider additional training for first-aiders in the **recognition and management of major illness**, including heart attack, stroke, epilepsy, asthma, and diabetes. L74 Appendix 4, Table 3 identifies this as training that may be required following a needs assessment where "the known health profile, age and number of employees" identifies a risk.

### 4.5 Appointed Person

An appointed person must always be available to take charge of first-aid arrangements whenever employees are at work. "Where an employer's assessment of first-aid needs identifies that a designated first-aider is not required, the minimum requirement for an employer is to appoint a person to take charge of the first-aid arrangements, including looking after the equipment and facilities, and calling the emergency services when required." [L74, para 78]. Where adequate first-aiders are in post, separate appointed persons are not necessary [L74, para 79]. However, a named appointed person should be identified for occasions when both first-aiders are working remotely, with all staff informed of the arrangement.

"Appointed persons do not need first-aid training, though they may benefit from completion of an EFAW course (or other suitable alternative)." [L74, para 80]

## 5. Summary of Provision Required

| Provision | Number Required | Training Level |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| First-aiders | **2** (minimum 1) | **EFAW** |
| Additional illness recognition training | Recommended for all first-aiders | L74, Appendix 4, Table 3 |
| Appointed person (for days when all first-aiders are off-site) | 1 named individual | No formal qualification required; EFAW recommended [L74, para 80] |
| First-aid kit | Minimum 1; recommend 1 per floor | Suitably stocked [L74, para 36] |

---

## 6. First Aid Equipment

A minimum of one suitably stocked first-aid container must be provided at each work site [L74, para 36]. Given the two-storey layout, a container on each floor is recommended to ensure prompt access [L74, para 23]. Containers should be easily accessible, preferably near hand-washing facilities, and clearly identified by a white cross on a green background [L74, para 37].

Medicines and tablets should not be kept in the first-aid container. The only exception is aspirin administered in accordance with current first-aid practice for a suspected heart attack [L74, para 42]. Given the presence of staff with known health conditions, this should be borne in mind when stocking the kit.

## 7. Information for Employees

<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/917/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">Regulation 4 of the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981</a> requires employers to inform all employees of the arrangements made in connection with first aid, including the location of equipment, facilities, and personnel. At a minimum:

- First-aid notices should be prominently displayed on both floors, identifying the name(s) of first-aiders, their location, and how to contact them.
- First-aid information should be provided to all new and transferred employees during induction [L74, para 83].
- Where an appointed person is in place on days when first-aiders are absent, all staff must be informed of who this is [L74, para 78].
- If any mental health support provision is in place, employees should be made aware of who to contact [L74, para 6].

---

## 8. Review

This assessment should be reviewed [L74, para 30]:

- Annually; and
- Following any significant change in workforce numbers, working patterns, premises layout, or employee health status; or
- Following any accident or incident attended by a first-aider.

All first-aid certificates are valid for **three years** [L74, para 74]. HSE strongly recommends that first-aiders undertake **annual refresher training** during the three-year certification period, although this is not a legal requirement [L74, para 75]. Employers should keep records of first-aiders and certification dates to facilitate timely renewal [L74, para 77].
