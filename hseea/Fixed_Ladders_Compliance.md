# Fixed Ladders and Hooped/Caged Ladders - Legislation and Compliance Guide

## Executive Summary

Fixed ladders in the UK are regulated primarily by the **Work at Height Regulations 2005**, supplemented by **BS 4211:2005+A1:2008** (UK standard) and **BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016** (European/international standard). They are subject to PUWER 1998 for maintenance and inspection requirements but generally NOT subject to LOLER 1998.

**Critical Safety Note:** HSE research shows that hoops/cages on fixed ladders do NOT provide complete fall arrest capability and may interfere with personal fall arrest systems.

## 1. PRIMARY LEGISLATION

### Work at Height Regulations 2005 - Schedule 6 (Requirements for Ladders)

#### Paragraph 1: When Ladders May Be Used
Ladders may only be used for work at height if a risk assessment demonstrates that more suitable work equipment is not justified because of:
- **Low risk** AND either:
  - (a) **Short duration of use**, OR
  - (b) **Existing features on site which cannot be altered**

#### Paragraph 2: Surface Requirements
The surface on which a ladder rests must be:
- Stable
- Firm
- Of sufficient strength
- Of suitable composition to safely support the ladder and any intended loading
- Such that rungs or steps remain horizontal

#### Paragraph 3: Positioning
A ladder must be positioned to ensure its stability during use.

#### Paragraph 4: Suspended Ladders
Suspended ladders must be:
- Attached in a secure manner
- Unable to be displaced (except flexible ladders)
- Prevented from swinging

#### Paragraph 5: Securing Portable Ladders
Portable ladders must be prevented from slipping by:
- (a) Securing the stiles at or near upper or lower ends, OR
- (b) Using effective anti-slip or other stability device, OR
- (c) Any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness

#### Paragraph 6: Access Requirements
Ladders used for access must protrude sufficiently above the landing place, unless other measures ensure a firm handhold.

#### Paragraph 7: Interlocking/Extension Ladders
No interlocking or extension ladder shall be used unless sections are prevented from moving relative to each other while in use.

#### Paragraph 8: Mobile Ladders
Mobile ladders must be prevented from moving before being stepped on.

#### Paragraph 9: **CRITICAL HEIGHT REQUIREMENT - Landing Areas/Rest Platforms**
**Where a ladder rises a vertical distance of 9 metres or more above its base, there shall, where reasonably practicable, be provided at suitable intervals sufficient safe landing areas or rest platforms.**

## 4. HOOPED/CAGED LADDERS - CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION

### When Hoops/Cages Are Required

**Threshold:** Fixed ladders over **2.5 metres** height require either:
- Safety cages/hoops, OR
- Fall arrest systems

**Source:** BS 4211 / UK industry practice

### HSE SAFETY BULLETIN - Hooped Ladders and Fall Arrest Systems

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**

1. **No Complete Fall Protection:** "There is NO evidence that hoops (also known as cages) on ladders provide complete fall arrest capability"

2. **Interference with Fall Arrest Equipment:** "If a fall arrest system is used there is a risk that the hoops can compromise its operation or effectiveness in preventing injury"

3. **Specific Risks Identified:**
   - Hoops may interfere with operation of fall arrest equipment (particularly inertia reel devices)
   - Users face injury risk from striking the cage during a fall
   - Hoops alone may not effectively arrest a fall without causing injury

### HSE Recommendations for Duty Holders

**DO:**
- ✓ Review risk assessments where hooped ladders are used
- ✓ Consider additional fall protection beyond hoops alone
- ✓ Evaluate alternative means of access where practicable
- ✓ Consult manufacturers about fall arrest equipment performance with hooped ladders
- ✓ Consider providing climbing helmets to reduce cage-strike injury risk

**DO NOT:**
- ✗ Blanket remove hoops (would probably increase overall risk)
- ✗ Prohibit use of fall arrest systems within hooped ladders
- ✗ Assume hoops provide complete fall protection

### HSE Research Reports

- **RR258:** Preliminary investigation into fall-arresting effectiveness of hooped ladders
- **RR657:** Investigation into fall-arresting effectiveness of ladder safety hoops when used with various fall-arrest systems

**Conclusion:** While hoops offer some benefits for ladder access, they may interfere with fall arrest equipment operation and do not provide complete fall protection.
