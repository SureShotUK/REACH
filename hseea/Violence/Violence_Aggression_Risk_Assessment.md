## 1. Purpose and Scope

This assessment fulfils the duty under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/regulation/3/made" target="_blank">Regulation 3 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999</a> to carry out a suitable and sufficient assessment of risks to employees. It covers all employees and work activities carried out by *[Company Name]* at all company sites, and work carried out by employees away from company premises (including delivery drivers).

The HSE defines work-related violence as:

> *"Any incident in which a person is abused, threatened or assaulted in circumstances relating to their work."*

This definition includes physical assault, verbal abuse (face-to-face, telephone and online), threats, and psychological abuse. The HSE states that verbal abuse and threats are the most common form of work-related violence and can cause serious harm to mental health; they must be addressed in the risk assessment.

This assessment should be read alongside the company's Violence and Aggression Policy, which sets out the company's commitments to staff.

## 2. Legal Framework

| Legislation | Relevance |
|-------------|-----------|
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/2" target="_blank">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.2</a> | General duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees so far as is reasonably practicable. Violence is a health and safety risk within this duty. |
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/regulation/3/made" target="_blank">Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 3</a> | Requires a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of risks to employees. Where violence is a foreseeable risk it must be assessed. Employers with 5 or more employees must record significant findings. |
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1471/contents/made" target="_blank">Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR)</a> | Physical assaults resulting in death, a specified injury, or incapacity for more than 7 consecutive days must be reported to the HSE. Incapacity of 3–7 days must be recorded internally. Verbal abuse without injury is not RIDDOR-reportable but should be recorded internally. |

## 3. Business Profile

*[Company Name]* is a business-to-business (B2B) company *[FILL IN: brief description of business activity and products/services]*. The company operates from *[FILL IN: number of sites and descriptions]*.

**This is an exclusively B2B operation.** The company has no premises open to the general public, does not deal with members of the public, and all customer and supplier contact is with other businesses. Visitors to company premises are invited business contacts.

### Employee Groups

| Employee Group | Number | Work Location | Lone Worker? |
|----------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Office staff | 4 | Company office premises | Occasionally (early/late working) |
| Delivery drivers | 3 | On road and at customer premises | Yes — by nature of role |
| Warehouse operatives | 3 | Company warehouse/manufacturing site | Occasionally (early/late working) |
| **Total** | **10** | | |

### Operational Factors Relevant to Violence Risk

- All operations are B2B; staff do not interact with members of the general public
- No cash is handled at point of delivery
- Drivers visit industrial and commercial customer premises only; no private residential deliveries
- Visitors to company premises are invited in advance and sign in on arrival
- CCTV is installed at company premises
- Standard working hours apply; occasional lone working on premises outside core hours
- Drivers carry mobile phones

## 4. Consultation

This assessment was prepared in consultation with *[FILL IN: names or 'employee representatives']*. Staff were asked whether they had experienced or witnessed any incidents of violence or aggression in their work. No incidents were reported prior to this assessment.

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Risk Rating Method

**Likelihood**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Very unlikely — could happen but almost certainly won't |
| 2 | Unlikely — could happen but rarely |
| 3 | Possible — might happen occasionally |
| 4 | Likely — will probably happen |
| 5 | Very likely — almost certain to happen |

**Severity**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible — no injury; no time off work |
| 2 | Minor — first aid required; short-term discomfort |
| 3 | Moderate — medical treatment; short-term absence (up to a week) |
| 4 | Severe — significant injury; long-term absence; psychological harm |
| 5 | Fatal or catastrophic |

**Risk Rating = Likelihood × Severity**

| Rating | Score | Required Action |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Low | 1–4 | Acceptable; maintain existing controls and monitor |
| Medium | 5–9 | Action required; review and improve controls within agreed timescale |
| High | 10–16 | Urgent action required; do not continue without implementing additional controls |
| Very High | 17–25 | Stop activity; immediate action required |

---

### 5.2 Scenario 1: Business Visitors to Office Premises

**Who might be harmed:** Office staff

**Nature of hazard:** An invited business visitor (customer, supplier, or other professional contact) attending company office premises becomes verbally abusive, threatening, or physically aggressive during a meeting or visit.

**Why this risk is low:** All visitors are expected and invited in advance; there is no walk-in or public access. Visitors attend for a mutual commercial purpose. A sign-in procedure is in place, creating a record of identity and attendance. CCTV covers the premises.

**Existing controls:**
- All visitors are invited and expected in advance; no unannounced public access
- Visitor sign-in procedure in place at reception/entrance
- CCTV installed and operational at premises
- Small workforce means staff are rarely alone with visitors

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Likelihood (with existing controls) | 1 |
| Severity | 3 |
| **Current risk rating** | **3 — Low** |

**Additional controls required:**

| Ref | Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| A1 | Brief all office staff on the procedure if a visitor becomes threatening: ask them to leave; call a colleague or manager; call police (999) if necessary; do not attempt to physically intervene | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |

**Residual risk after all controls:** 2 — Low

---

### 5.3 Scenario 2: Abusive or Threatening Contact by Telephone or Email

**Who might be harmed:** Office staff (particularly those handling customer/supplier calls and correspondence)

**Nature of hazard:** A customer, supplier, or other business contact contacts an employee by telephone or email and is verbally abusive, uses threatening language, or engages in persistent harassment or intimidation. The HSE's definition of work-related violence expressly includes telephone and online abuse. Persistent or serious verbal abuse can cause significant psychological harm and is a health and safety matter.

**Existing controls:**
- Company Violence and Aggression Policy states that verbal abuse of staff will not be tolerated
- No formal documented procedure currently exists for staff to follow when dealing with an abusive call

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Likelihood (with existing controls) | 2 |
| Severity | 2 |
| **Current risk rating** | **4 — Low** |

**Additional controls required:**

| Ref | Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| A2 | Establish and document a written procedure for handling abusive telephone and email contact. The procedure must clearly state: (1) staff may warn the caller once that their behaviour is unacceptable; (2) if the behaviour continues, staff may end the call without repercussions from management; (3) staff should report the incident using the company incident log | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A3 | Communicate the procedure to all office staff and confirm understanding | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A9 | Establish and maintain a company incident log for recording all violence/aggression incidents including abusive calls and emails (see Section 7) | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |

**Notes:** For a B2B operation, abusive calls are unlikely to be frequent, and commercial relationships carry mutual accountability. However, if the incident log reveals a pattern with specific customers or contacts, this should be escalated with management and those contacts formally notified that abusive behaviour will not be tolerated.

**Residual risk after all controls:** 2 — Low

---

### 5.4 Scenario 3: Delivery Drivers — Lone Workers at Customer Premises

**Who might be harmed:** Delivery drivers

**Nature of hazard:** A driver attending a customer's industrial or commercial site encounters an aggressive or threatening individual. This may be a customer employee, visitor to the customer's premises, or an intruder. Drivers are lone workers; there is no colleague present to assist or raise the alarm. This is the highest-risk scenario in this assessment due to the combination of lone working and attendance at premises not under the company's control.

**Why the inherent risk remains low-medium despite mitigating factors:** The B2B context, absence of cash, and commercial relationships significantly reduce the likelihood of aggression. However, lone working means any incident — even a verbal altercation — carries higher potential impact because the driver has no immediate support.

**Existing controls:**
- All deliveries are to known and established B2B customers; no deliveries to private residences or anonymous members of the public
- No cash changes hands at point of delivery
- Drivers carry mobile phones and can contact the office

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Likelihood (with existing controls) | 2 |
| Severity | 3 |
| **Current risk rating** | **6 — Medium** |

**Additional controls required:**

| Ref | Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| A4 | Establish a formal driver check-in procedure. As a minimum: drivers should contact the office on arrival at and departure from each delivery. The office must have a procedure to initiate a welfare check if a driver has not made contact within an agreed time after an expected delivery. | *[Transport Manager/Owner]* | *[Date]* |
| A5 | Communicate to all drivers, in writing, that they have the explicit right to refuse a delivery and leave any premises immediately if they feel unsafe or threatened, without any repercussion from management. Drivers should not attempt to resolve threatening situations by confrontation. | *[Transport Manager/Owner]* | *[Date]* |
| A6a | Establish an emergency contact procedure for drivers operating outside standard office hours: a named emergency contact (personal mobile) who can be reached if the office is unstaffed. | *[Transport Manager/Owner]* | *[Date]* |
| A6b | Maintain a daily delivery schedule so that driver whereabouts are known at all times during the working day. | *[Transport Manager/Owner]* | *[Date]* |
| A10 | Advise drivers of the actions to take if threatened or assaulted: (1) move away from the situation; (2) do not attempt to recover goods by force; (3) call 999 if in immediate danger; (4) call the office/emergency contact; (5) report the incident using the company incident log. | *[Transport Manager/Owner]* | *[Date]* |

**Note on pre-delivery intelligence:** If any customer site is known or suspected to present unusual risk (e.g. security concerns raised by a driver), this should be noted and management should assess whether additional precautions are needed before the next delivery to that site.

**Residual risk after all controls:** 3 — Low

---

### 5.5 Scenario 4: Lone Working on Company Premises Outside Core Hours

**Who might be harmed:** Any employee working alone on company premises before or after standard working hours

**Nature of hazard:** An employee working alone on site (e.g. early morning start, late finish, or occasional weekend working) encounters an unauthorised person who has gained access to the premises. The primary risk is from an opportunistic intruder rather than a known individual. The lone worker is more vulnerable due to the absence of colleagues nearby.

**Existing controls:**
- CCTV installed and operational
- Premises are lockable
- Staff carry mobile phones

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Likelihood (with existing controls) | 1 |
| Severity | 3 |
| **Current risk rating** | **3 — Low** |

**Additional controls required:**

| Ref | Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| A6c | Establish a lone worker check-in procedure for on-site working outside core hours: (1) the employee must notify a designated contact before commencing lone working and confirm their expected finish time; (2) the employee must confirm safe completion to the designated contact; (3) the designated contact must initiate a welfare check if no confirmation is received by the agreed time. | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A11 | Confirm that premises access points are secured when an employee is working alone on site (doors locked, windows closed). Include this in the lone worker procedure. | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A12 | Ensure all employees have a charged mobile phone with them at all times when lone working on site. | *[Manager]* | *[Date]* |

**Residual risk after all controls:** 2 — Low

---

### 5.6 Scenario 5: Warehouse Operatives — Interactions with Third-Party Drivers and Contractors

**Who might be harmed:** Warehouse operatives

**Nature of hazard:** Third-party delivery drivers, collection drivers, or contractors attending the warehouse become verbally abusive or threatening. Disputes may arise over loading/unloading procedures, waiting times, or damage to goods. The warehouse environment involves contact with individuals from outside the company who are not subject to the company's own behavioural expectations.

**Existing controls:**
- CCTV covers warehouse/loading areas
- Warehouse supervisory presence during normal operations

| | Score |
|---|---|
| Likelihood (with existing controls) | 2 |
| Severity | 2 |
| **Current risk rating** | **4 — Low** |

**Additional controls required:**

| Ref | Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| A7 | Confirm that the visitor/contractor sign-in procedure extends to the warehouse and loading areas, not only to the office reception | *[Warehouse Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A8 | Install notices at warehouse entrance/loading bay advising that verbal abuse, threats, or aggressive behaviour towards staff will not be tolerated and may result in refusal of service and reporting to police | *[Warehouse Manager]* | *[Date]* |
| A13 | Brief warehouse operatives on the incident reporting procedure and confirm they know how to request management support if a third-party driver or contractor becomes abusive | *[Warehouse Manager]* | *[Date]* |

**Residual risk after all controls:** 2 — Low

## 7. Incident Reporting

### Internal Reporting

All incidents of violence or aggression must be reported to *[FILL IN: designated manager/person]* and recorded in the company incident log within 24 hours of the incident. This includes:

- Physical assaults (including attempted assaults)
- Verbal threats
- Verbal abuse (face-to-face, by telephone, or online/email)
- Threatening behaviour or intimidation
- Near misses

The purpose of recording all incidents, including minor ones, is to identify patterns and trends that may indicate a need to review controls, and to support any affected employee.

**Action A9** above requires this log to be established if not already in place.

### RIDDOR Reporting

The following thresholds apply under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1471/contents/made" target="_blank">Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR)</a>:

| Outcome of Physical Assault | RIDDOR Action |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Death of an employee | Report immediately to HSE |
| Specified injury (e.g. fracture, amputation, loss of consciousness, hospitalisation for more than 24 hours) | Report to HSE within 10 days |
| Employee incapacitated for more than 7 consecutive days (not counting day of incident) | Report to HSE within 15 days |
| Employee incapacitated for 3–7 days | Record internally; no RIDDOR report required |
| No injury / verbal abuse only | Record internally; no RIDDOR report required |

RIDDOR reports are submitted via the <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor/report.htm" target="_blank">HSE incident reporting system</a>.

---

## 8. Post-Incident Support

Following any incident of violence or aggression, the company will:

1. Ensure the affected employee receives immediate first aid or medical attention if required
2. Remove the employee from the situation if it is ongoing
3. Offer appropriate psychological support — this may include time off, a referral to the employee's GP, or access to counselling. The company's Violence and Aggression Policy commits to providing any counselling or post-incident assistance required
4. Support the employee's decision as to whether to report the matter to the police and press criminal charges
5. Debrief with the affected employee (once recovered) to understand what happened and identify any lessons
6. Review this risk assessment if the incident reveals a gap in existing controls

Affected employees should not feel they must return to work before they are ready, and must not face any pressure to accept abusive behaviour as part of their role.

---

## 9. Training

All employees will be made aware of the following as part of their induction and periodic refresher training:

- The company's Violence and Aggression Policy
- The findings of this risk assessment and the controls relevant to their role
- The incident reporting procedure and how to use the incident log
- Their right to refuse to continue dealing with an abusive individual (whether in person, by phone, or online) without fear of employer repercussions
- Who to contact for support following an incident

**Drivers and lone workers** will additionally be trained on:

- Personal safety awareness when lone working
- Actions to take if threatened at a customer site (leave safely, do not confront, call for help)
- The driver check-in procedure
- Their right to refuse a delivery if they feel unsafe

Training should be recorded. *[FILL IN: training records location/system]*

---

## 10. Review

This risk assessment will be reviewed:

- **Annually** as a minimum — next review due **February 2027**
- **Following any incident** of violence or aggression
- **Following a near miss** involving a potential violent situation
- **When working arrangements change significantly** — including new customer sites, changed delivery routes, changes to staffing or lone working arrangements
- **When a new hazard is identified** by staff consultation or observation
