## Introduction

This guide tells you what to do if you experience violence or aggression in the course of your work. It applies to all staff, regardless of your role or where you are working.

[Company Name] takes violence and aggression seriously. We define it as physical assault or threats, verbal abuse (including swearing, shouting, and threatening language), and psychological intimidation — whether face-to-face, by telephone, or in writing. None of these are acceptable, and none should be treated as a normal part of your job.

This guide has three chapters, each written for a specific staff group. Read the chapter that applies to your role. The sections on reporting and post-incident support at the end apply to everyone.

This guide should be read alongside the company's Violence and Aggression Policy and the Violence and Aggression Risk Assessment (VA-RA-001).

## Your Rights

Before reading the chapter for your role, be clear about your rights. These apply to all staff:

- **You have the right to refuse to continue dealing with someone who is abusive.** You may end a call, stop a meeting, or leave a situation. You will not be criticised or disciplined for doing so.
- **You have the right to leave a threatening situation immediately** — even if this means leaving goods, leaving a site, or stopping work mid-task. Your personal safety takes priority over completing a delivery or a transaction.
- **You have the right to call the police (999) if you are in immediate danger.** Do not hesitate. Do not wait for management approval.
- **You have the right to report any incident** without fear of negative consequences. We will take your report seriously.
- **You have the right to support after an incident.** Management will not expect you to simply carry on. We will ask what you need.

## Chapter 1: Office Staff

This chapter covers office staff dealing with aggression and threatening behaviour from customers, suppliers, and other business contacts. It covers three situations:

- **1A** — Abusive or threatening telephone calls
- **1B** — Abusive or threatening emails
- **1C** — Aggressive visitors on company premises

---

### 1A — Abusive or Threatening Telephone Calls

If a caller becomes abusive, threatening, or uses language that makes you uncomfortable:

**What to do:**

1. Give one clear, calm warning: *"I'd like to continue helping you, but I will need to end this call if the language continues."* Say this once. You do not need to explain or justify it further.
2. If the abusive behaviour continues after the warning, end the call. You may say *"I'm going to end this call now"* and hang up. You are not required to stay on the line.
3. Do not call the person back immediately. If the matter requires a follow-up call, wait until you feel ready, or ask your line manager to make the call on your behalf.
4. Tell your line manager what happened as soon as practical.
5. Complete an incident report (see Appendix A), even if you feel the matter was minor. Record the date, time, caller's name or company (if known), what was said, and what you did.
6. If the caller makes a specific threat to harm you or a named colleague, tell your manager immediately. Serious threats may need to be reported to the police.

**What not to do:**

- Do not try to argue back or reason with someone who is in an agitated state — this rarely helps and can escalate the situation.
- Do not issue the warning more than once. If abusive behaviour continues after one warning, end the call.
- Do not feel you must continue the call out of courtesy or concern about the business relationship.

---

### 1B — Abusive or Threatening Emails

If you receive an email that is abusive, threatening, or uses language designed to intimidate you:

**What to do:**

1. Do not reply directly to the email. Responding in writing when emotions are running high rarely resolves the situation and can create an escalating exchange.
2. Forward the email to your line manager without replying.
3. Your line manager will decide how and whether to respond, and will do so on behalf of the company.
4. Complete an incident report. Save or print the email so there is a record of it.
5. If the email contains a direct threat to harm you or a colleague, tell your manager immediately. The email may need to be passed to the police.

**What not to do:**

- Do not delete the email — it is evidence and should be retained.
- Do not feel obliged to handle the response yourself.

### 1C — Aggressive Visitors on Company Premises

All visitors to company premises are expected and invited in advance, and sign in on arrival. If someone arrives unannounced and appears angry or agitated, treat this as a warning sign and involve your manager from the outset.

If a visitor who is on site becomes verbally aggressive or threatening during a meeting or visit:

**What to do:**

1. Stay calm. Lower your own voice — do not match the other person's tone or volume.
2. Acknowledge their frustration without arguing the point: *"I can see this is important to you"* or *"I understand you're not happy with how this has been handled."* You are not agreeing with them; you are acknowledging that they are upset.
3. Offer a concrete next step: *"Let me get my manager so we can look at this properly."* This gives the person a sense of progress and removes you from the immediate dynamic.
4. Keep a clear path to the door if possible. Be aware of your exit. Do not allow yourself to be cornered.
5. If the person becomes physically threatening or you believe you or a colleague are in danger, leave the room or area immediately. Go to where other colleagues are. Do not attempt to manage the situation alone.
6. Call 999 if the person is physically violent or you have good reason to believe they are about to become violent. Do not wait. Protecting you and your colleagues is the priority.
7. Once you are safe: alert your manager, and complete an incident report. Do not return to the situation alone.

**What not to do:**

- Do not attempt to physically intervene, restrain, or block the person's exit. This is not your responsibility and significantly increases the risk of injury.
- Do not argue about the substance of a dispute while the person is in an agitated state.
- Do not be alone with a visitor who is behaving in a way that makes you uncomfortable. If a meeting becomes tense, involve a colleague or manager.

## Chapter 2: Warehouse Operatives

This chapter covers warehouse operatives dealing with aggressive or threatening behaviour from third-party delivery drivers, collection drivers, and contractors attending the warehouse or loading bay.

The most common triggers for aggression in this environment are waiting times, loading or unloading sequencing, paperwork disputes, and concerns about goods condition. These disputes are not yours to resolve — they are for management. Your job is to stay safe and get the right person involved.

The warehouse and loading bay are covered by CCTV. All third-party drivers and contractors are required to sign in before entering. The loading bay displays a notice that abusive or threatening behaviour is not tolerated and may result in refusal of service.

**What to do if a third-party driver or contractor becomes abusive or threatening:**

1. Do not argue about the cause of the dispute. Say clearly: *"I understand you're not happy. Let me get my supervisor."* Then go and get them. This is the single most effective step you can take.
2. While you are waiting for the supervisor, do not continue the conversation about the substance of the dispute. Step back and give the person space. You do not have to stand and engage.
3. If the person's behaviour escalates before the supervisor arrives — threatening language, aggressive gestures, or moving towards you — step away from the immediate area. Move to a part of the warehouse where you are not isolated. You do not need to remain at the loading bay.
4. If the situation escalates rapidly and you are unable to reach a supervisor quickly, leave the area and raise the alarm. Your supervisor or a manager will deal with the situation.
5. Do not attempt to continue the loading or unloading operation if the other person's behaviour is making it unsafe or highly stressful to do so. It is acceptable to pause operations until a supervisor is present.
6. Once the immediate situation has been resolved or handed to a supervisor: report the incident to your supervisor and complete an incident report.

**What not to do:**

- Do not try to resolve a dispute about damaged goods, a paperwork error, or a scheduling complaint yourself — these decisions sit with management, not with you.
- Do not block a vehicle or prevent a driver from leaving the site. Stand clear.
- Do not touch or physically attempt to restrain anyone, regardless of the circumstances.
- Do not retaliate with abusive language, even if you have been on the receiving end of it.

## Chapter 3: Delivery Drivers

This chapter applies to delivery drivers. Because you are a lone worker for much of your working day — attending customer sites without a colleague alongside you — you receive more detailed guidance than other staff groups.

Drivers make deliveries to known B2B customers at industrial and commercial sites only. You will not be delivering to private residences. No cash is exchanged at point of delivery. These factors keep the inherent risk low. However, because you are working alone and on premises that are not under our control, it is important that you know exactly what to do if a situation makes you feel unsafe.

---

### Before Each Delivery

The office holds the daily delivery schedule, which records the sequence of deliveries and expected timings for the day.

**Check-in procedure:**

- Call or message the office **on arrival** at each customer site and **on departure** from it.
- If you are delivering outside standard office hours, use the emergency contact number for your out-of-hours check-in.
- If you are unable to reach the office and cannot reach the emergency contact, send a text message recording your location.
- If you have not made contact within a reasonable time after an expected delivery, the office will attempt to call you. If they cannot reach you, they will initiate a welfare check.

Make sure before you set off that:

- Your mobile phone is fully charged.
- You have the office number and emergency contact number saved in your phone.
- The office has a copy of your delivery schedule for the day.

---

### If Something Feels Wrong

Trust your instinct. If something about a site or situation feels wrong when you arrive, you are not obligated to get out of the vehicle and proceed.

**What to do:**

1. Stay in your vehicle. Call the office and describe what you can see. Take guidance before deciding whether to proceed.
2. If you cannot reach the office, call the emergency contact.
3. If no one can be reached and you remain uncomfortable, you may drive away and notify the office as soon as you can.

You will not face any management consequences for raising a concern about a site, even if it turns out to be unfounded. It is far better to make the call than to put yourself in a situation you are not comfortable with.

---

### If You Feel Threatened During a Delivery

**What to do:**

1. **Move away from the situation immediately.** You do not need to argue, explain, or resolve anything on the spot. Leave the building or the immediate area.
2. **Return to your vehicle.** If you need to, drive away from the immediate area to put distance between yourself and the situation. Your vehicle gives you mobility.
3. **Do not attempt to recover the goods or protect the vehicle by confrontation.** Property can be replaced. Do not put yourself at risk for it.
4. **Once you are safe, call the office immediately.** Tell them: your current location, what happened, and your current status (whether you are injured, whether the police are needed).
5. **Call 999 if you have been assaulted, or if you believe the situation presents an immediate risk to your physical safety.** Do not wait for permission from the office to do this. Emergency services take priority.
6. **Do not return to the site.** Do not attempt a second delivery visit without first speaking to your manager. Your manager will decide whether and how the delivery is to be completed.
7. **Complete an incident report** when you are able to — do not delay until the end of the day. Doing it while the details are fresh helps us support you and review our controls.

---

### Your Right to Refuse a Delivery

You have the explicit right to refuse to complete a delivery and to leave any premises immediately if you feel unsafe. You do not need permission from the office to leave. You will not face any criticism or negative consequences for doing so.

This is not about convenience — it is a health and safety right, and management will back you up.

If you refuse a delivery on safety grounds:

- Call the office as soon as you are away from the site.
- Your manager will note the reason and will decide how to handle the undelivered goods and any customer communication.
- You should complete an incident report describing why you felt unsafe.

---

### What Not to Do as a Driver

- Do not confront an aggressive person or attempt to argue them down.
- Do not attempt to physically recover goods, prevent someone from taking them, or defend the vehicle by force.
- Do not return to a site where you have been threatened or made to feel unsafe without first speaking to your manager.
- Do not feel that staying on site and completing the delivery is the professional thing to do in a threatening situation. Walking away is the correct action.

---

## Reporting an Incident

All incidents of violence or aggression must be reported to your line manager as soon as practical, and no later than 24 hours after the incident. This applies to:

- Physical assault or attempted assault
- Verbal threats (whether in person, by telephone, or in writing)
- Verbal abuse (face-to-face, by telephone, or by email or message)
- Threatening or intimidating behaviour
- Near misses — situations that came close to an incident even if nothing happened

**Even if you feel the incident was minor, please report it.** We record all incidents so that we can spot patterns, review our controls, and support you properly. A single incident that appears minor may be part of a wider pattern we need to be aware of.

Complete an incident report form (Appendix A) and submit it to your line manager. Drivers may call in a verbal report first, then complete the form when they return to base.

Your report will be treated in confidence and will not be used against you in any way.

---

## After an Incident

[Company Name] is committed to supporting every member of staff following any incident of violence or aggression, regardless of its severity.

After an incident, management will:

- Ensure you receive immediate first aid or medical attention if needed.
- Remove you from the situation if it is still ongoing, and ensure you are in a safe environment.
- Ask what you need — you will not be expected to return to your normal duties before you are ready.
- Offer appropriate support, which may include time off, a referral to your GP, or access to counselling. You will not be pressed to accept support before you want it.
- Support your decision about whether to report the matter to the police. This is your decision to make. We will help you, not make it for you.
- Debrief with you once you have had a chance to recover, so that we can understand what happened and identify whether any additional measures are needed.
- Review the relevant risk assessment if the incident suggests our existing controls need to be improved.

You should not feel that you must accept abusive or violent behaviour as part of your job. It is not.
