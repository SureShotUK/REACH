## Scenarios Assessed

The risk assessment covers five scenarios relevant to this business:

1. Business visitors to office premises
2. Abusive/threatening telephone or email contact from customers
3. Delivery drivers as lone workers at customer sites *(highest-risk scenario)*
4. Lone working on company premises outside core hours
5. Warehouse operatives - interactions with third-party drivers and contractors

## Key Outstanding Actions (as at February 2026)

All actions are captured in the risk assessment action table. Priority actions include:

- Establishing a formal driver check-in procedure (A4)
- Communicating drivers' right to refuse delivery if unsafe (A5)
- Written procedure for handling abusive telephone/email contact (A2)
- Lone worker procedure for on-site out-of-hours working (A6)
- Incident recording log (A9)

## Review and Maintenance

The risk assessment should be reviewed annually (next due February 2027) and following any incident of violence or aggression. This CLAUDE.md should be updated whenever new documents are added or the business context changes materially.
