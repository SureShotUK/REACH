## 2. Purpose and Scope

This document sets out the duties and step-by-step procedure that each fire marshal must follow when a fire alarm is activated and an evacuation is required. It applies to all staff, visitors, and contractors on site.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Fire Marshal

Each fire marshal is assigned a **designated zone** of the premises and is responsible for:

- Ensuring all occupants in that zone evacuate safely and promptly
- Conducting a sweep of their zone before leaving the building
- Closing fire doors behind them as they evacuate
- Guiding occupants to the assembly point
- Reporting status to the Head Fire Marshal at the assembly point

### 3.2 Nominated Person — Grab Bag

An individual, designated in advance, who is responsible for collecting the **grab bag** on the way out of the building during an evacuation.

### 3.3 Nominated Person — Sign-In Boards

A separate individual, designated in advance, who is responsible for collecting the **sign-in boards** on the way out of the building during an evacuation, **if it is safe to do so**. If conditions make it unsafe to collect the sign-in boards, this person must proceed directly to the assembly point and report this to the Head Fire Marshal immediately.

### 3.4 Head Fire Marshal / Assembly Point Warden

The most senior fire marshal on site at the time of evacuation, responsible for:

- Receiving reports from all zone fire marshals
- Coordinating the headcount at the assembly point
- Briefing the fire and rescue service on arrival
- Making the decision on whether and when to stand down

## 4. Pre-Evacuation Preparation

Every fire marshal must be familiar with the following before an evacuation occurs:

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Designated zone | The specific area(s) they are responsible for |
| Evacuation routes | Primary and secondary exit routes from their zone |
| Assembly point | The location and layout of the designated assembly point |
| Fire alarm call points | Location of all manual call points in their zone |
| Fire extinguishers | Location and type of extinguisher(s) in their zone |
| Fire doors | Location and function of all fire doors in their zone |
| Grab bag | Location of the grab bag (nominated person — grab bag responsibility) |
| Sign-in boards | Location of the sign-in boards (nominated person — sign-in boards responsibility) |
| Vulnerable persons | Any individuals in their zone who may require assistance, and whether a personal evacuation plan (PEP) is in place |

---

## 5. Evacuation Procedure

### Phase 1 — Alarm and Initial Response

1. On hearing the fire alarm, **assume it is a genuine emergency** until confirmed otherwise by an authorised person. Do not ignore the alarm or wait for further information.
2. Stop all work immediately. Secure or isolate any machinery or processes that can be left safely; do not delay evacuation to shut down equipment.
3. Remain calm. Speak clearly and assertively to guide occupants in your zone.

### Phase 2 — Evacuation of the Zone

4. Instruct all occupants in your designated zone to evacuate immediately via the nearest safe exit route.
5. **Do not use lifts** at any time during an evacuation.
6. Assist or direct vulnerable persons towards the exit. Where a personal evacuation plan (PEP) is in place for an individual, follow that plan.
7. **Conduct a sweep** of your zone before leaving: check all rooms, offices, toilets, storerooms, and any other spaces that could be occupied, to confirm they are empty.
8. **Close all fire doors** behind you as you evacuate. Do not lock them.

### Phase 3 — Nominated Person Duties

9. The **nominated person (grab bag)** must collect the **grab bag** on the way out of the building.
10. The **nominated person (sign-in boards)** must collect the **sign-in boards** on the way out, **if it is safe to do so**. If the route past the sign-in boards is blocked, smoke-affected, or otherwise unsafe, this person must proceed directly to the assembly point and report the situation to the Head Fire Marshal.

### Phase 4 — Route to Assembly Point

11. Follow the designated evacuation route to the assembly point. If the primary route is blocked or unsafe, use the secondary route.
12. If smoke is encountered, **stay as low as possible** and crawl if necessary — cleaner air will be near floor level.
13. On reaching the assembly point, guide occupants to their designated zone area.

### Phase 5 — Assembly Point Procedures

14. Remain with your zone group at the assembly point.
15. Assist the Head Fire Marshal or Assembly Point Warden with the headcount. Use the sign-in boards (if collected) to verify that all registered persons are present.
16. **Immediately report any persons unaccounted for** to the Head Fire Marshal.

### Phase 6 — Briefing the Fire and Rescue Service

17. On arrival of the fire and rescue service, the Head Fire Marshal or designated coordinator must provide:
    - The nature of the alarm (if known)
    - The location of the suspected fire or hazard
    - The number of people on site and any persons unaccounted for
    - The location of any dangerous or hazardous substances on the premises

### Phase 7 — Holding and Stand Down

18. **Do not allow anyone to re-enter the building** until the fire and rescue service or Head Fire Marshal has formally confirmed it is safe to do so.
19. Once the all-clear has been given, occupants may re-enter in an orderly manner.

## 6. Special Considerations

### 6.1 Vulnerable Persons

Persons who may require additional assistance during an evacuation include:

- People with mobility or sensory impairments
- Pregnant employees
- Visitors or contractors unfamiliar with the building layout

A **personal evacuation plan (PEP)** should be in place for any individual who cannot evacuate independently. Fire marshals must know which individuals in their zone have a PEP in place and where those individuals are likely to be located.

### 6.2 Dangerous Substances

Where the premises contain dangerous substances (e.g., flammable chemicals, compressed gases), the grab bag should contain — or be located alongside — the relevant safety data sheets or a summary of the hazards present. This information must be made available to the fire and rescue service on their arrival. This reflects the duty under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/16/made" target="_blank">Article 16</a> of the Fire Safety Order.

### 6.3 Visitors and Contractors

Visitors and contractors must be briefed on evacuation procedures before entering the premises. They should be aware of:
- The nearest exit to their location
- The location of the assembly point
- The need to sign in on arrival (to enable accurate headcount)

## 7. Training

All fire marshals must receive appropriate training before assuming the role and at regular intervals thereafter, in accordance with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/21/made" target="_blank">Article 21</a> of the Fire Safety Order. Training must cover:

- The contents of this evacuation plan
- The duties specific to their zone and their role
- The use of portable fire extinguishers (where appropriate)
- The location of exits, alarm call points, and the assembly point
- Procedures for assisting vulnerable persons

Fire evacuation **drills** should be carried out at regular intervals. Best practice for most premises is at least once per year, though more frequent drills may be required depending on the nature of the premises and the number of occupants.

---

## 8. Record Keeping

- Sign-in boards used during an evacuation must be retained as a record of the event.
- A **post-evacuation report** should be completed following every evacuation — whether genuine or a drill — recording:
    - Date and time of the alarm and the evacuation
    - Cause of the alarm (genuine fire, false alarm, or planned drill)
    - Number of persons evacuated and accounted for
    - Any persons unaccounted for and the outcome
    - Any issues identified during the evacuation
    - Corrective actions to be taken and who is responsible for them
