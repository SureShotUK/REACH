## 1. INFORMATION TO GATHER BEFORE CONTACTING EA

### 1.1 Site Location Details

**Essential information to have ready:**

- [ ] **Full site address**: [Complete postal address]
- [ ] **Site Grid Reference**: OS National Grid 12-figure reference SE 78097 47989 (from https://gridreferencefinder.com/)
- [ ] **Site boundary plan**: Scaled plan showing site perimeter, buildings, proposed RO system location
- [ ] **Land ownership**: Confirm you own/control the land where discharge point will be located
- [ ] **Planning permission status**: Is the RO system installation permitted development or does it require planning consent?

**How to obtain:**
- Grid reference: Use online tool with exact discharge location on map
- Site plan: CAD drawing, architects' plan, or annotated OS map extract
- Land ownership: Land Registry title documents

### 1.2 Receiving Watercourse Information

**Critical to identify before consultation:**

- [ ] **Watercourse name**: What is the stream officially called? Unnamed Drain
- [ ] **Watercourse type**: agricultural drain
- [ ] **Discharge location**: Exact grid reference for proposed outfall point SE 78168 47995
- [ ] **Distance to confluence**: How far to next named watercourse? Which watercourse does it flow into? Stone Beck
- [ ] **Preliminary flow observation**: Does it flow year-round or is it seasonal/ephemeral?
- [ ] **Approximate stream width/depth**: Visual estimate at proposed discharge point 1m

**How to obtain:**
- OS Explorer Map 294 (Market Weighton & Yorkshire Wolds Central) - shows watercourses
- Magic Map (https://magic.defra.gov.uk/) - overlay "Main Rivers" and WFD water bodies
- Site visit with photos and observations
- Local knowledge from land drainage authority (East Riding of Yorkshire Council)

**Key question for EA**: "We believe the receiving watercourse is [name/description]. Can you confirm the WFD waterbody designation and current ecological/chemical status?"

### 1.3 Operational Details

**Process description - be specific:**

- [ ] **RO system specification**:
  - Feed water source: Potable mains supply (Yorkshire Water)
  - Membrane type: [specify if known, or state "to be specified"]
  - Recovery rate: 65% (35% becomes concentrate)
  - Operating pressure: [specify if known]
  - Pretreatment: [specify any carbon filters, softeners, etc.]

- [ ] **Operating pattern**:
  - Maximum daily volume: 44,667 L/day feed = 15,634 L/day concentrate discharge
  - Operating days per year: 250 days/year (Monday-Friday, excluding holidays)
  - Operating hours: 8 hours/day
  - Maximum instantaneous discharge rate: 15,634 L ÷ 8 hrs = 1,954 L/hour or 0.54 L/s
  - Seasonal variation: Year-round operation during working days

- [ ] **End use of purified water**:
  - [Specify exact use - e.g., "ingredient in pharmaceutical formulation", "laboratory analysis", "cleaning validated equipment"]
  - Why is RO-quality water needed? Used in the manufacture of AdBlue.

- [ ] **Site industrial classification**:
  - SIC Code: 21.20 (Manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations)
  - Number of employees: 7
  - Other site activities: The site is an agricultural grain store which also houses a haulage yard, home furnishings business and Wolds Produce as well as providing storage for some private clients.

**Calculate key figures before consultation:**

```
Maximum instantaneous discharge rate (critical for dilution assessment):
- Operating 8 hours/day: 15,634 L ÷ 8 hrs ÷ 3600 s = 0.54 L/s
- Per hour rate: 15,634 L ÷ 8 hrs = 1,954 L/hour

Annual discharge volume:
- 15,634 L/day × 250 days/year = 3,908,500 L/year = 3,908.5 m³/year
```

### 1.4 Site Drainage & Segregation

**EA will ask about drainage to confirm RO concentrate is isolated from contamination:**

- [ ] **Site drainage plan**: Drawing showing:
  - Clean rainwater drainage routes
  - Foul sewer connections (if any)
  - Process/contaminated drainage routes
  - Proposed RO concentrate discharge point and routing

- [ ] **Drainage segregation confirmation**:
  - Where is proposed RO system located? Seperate warehouse unit bought specifically for the manufacture of AdBlue.
  - What other drains/activities are nearby? Clean rain water drains which drain from the site.
  - How will you prevent cross-contamination from pharmaceutical production drains? There are no drains in the manufacture warehouse.
  - Is there a spill containment plan if RO system location is near production areas? Yes there is a spill containment plan.

**Critical for pharmaceutical site**: EA needs absolute confidence that API-containing drainage cannot mix with RO concentrate. Be prepared to describe physical segregation measures.

### 1.5 Feed Water Quality Data

**Obtain from Yorkshire Water or test yourself:**

- [ ] **Recent water quality analysis** (within last 12 months) showing:
  - pH
  - Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) or conductivity
  - Hardness (calcium, magnesium)
  - Chloride
  - Sulphate
  - Nitrate
  - Sodium
  - Heavy metals (if available)
  - Microbiological parameters (if available)

**How to obtain:**
- Yorkshire Water Annual Water Quality Report for your supply zone
- Yorkshire Water customer services may provide zone-specific data
- Or commission independent analysis (£200-£400 for basic suite)

**Why this matters**: EA needs to predict concentrate composition. With potable feed water, concentrate will be relatively clean but 2-3× concentrated in dissolved salts.

## 2. QUESTIONS TO ASK THE EA

### 2.1 Feasibility Questions (PRIORITY)

**Ask these first to determine if project is viable:**

1. **"Based on the receiving watercourse [name/description] at grid reference [XX], and a proposed discharge of up to 0.4-1.2 L/s [specify your rate], do you foresee any fundamental obstacles to granting a discharge consent?"**
   - This is the critical go/no-go question
   - If EA says "unlikely to be acceptable", you need to know now

2. **"What is the WFD waterbody designation for this receiving watercourse, and what is its current ecological and chemical status?"**
   - Determines baseline and whether waterbody is already failing (higher scrutiny)

3. **"Are there any designated sites (SAC, SPA, SSSI, Ramsar) that could be hydrologically connected to this discharge?"**
   - Lower Derwent Valley is nearby - need to confirm if HRA screening required

4. **"Are there any Source Protection Zones in this area that could be affected?"**
   - Confirms if groundwater protection issues exist

5. **"Given this is a pharmaceutical manufacturing site, what level of evidence will you require to demonstrate that APIs cannot enter the RO concentrate stream?"**
   - Understand scrutiny level and evidence requirements

### 2.2 Technical Specification Questions

6. **"What discharge consent parameters would typically apply to RO concentrate discharges to small watercourses?"**
   - Ask specifically about: pH limits, flow rate limits, temperature limits, BOD/COD, suspended solids, TDS/conductivity, specific ions (chloride, sulphate)

7. **"What dilution ratio would you expect for this discharge and receiving watercourse?"**
   - Typically 8:1 (95th percentile low flow), but may be higher for sensitive waters
   - This determines if watercourse flow is sufficient

8. **"Will we need to monitor the receiving watercourse flow, and if so, for how long before application?"**
   - Flow monitoring is expensive and time-consuming
   - Need to know duration (typically 4-12 weeks minimum)

9. **"What effluent monitoring frequency would be required?"**
   - Determines ongoing operational costs

### 2.3 Application Process Questions

10. **"Should we apply for a bespoke permit or is there any possibility of using standard rules?"**
    - Confirm permit type (almost certainly bespoke, but worth asking)

11. **"What supporting assessments will be required for the application?"**
    - Confirm: WFD compliance assessment, ecological impact assessment, HRA screening, mixing zone assessment, etc.

12. **"Do you recommend any specific consultants or specialists for this type of application in Yorkshire?"**
    - EA can't endorse specific companies but may suggest types of expertise needed

13. **"What is the current determination timeline for bespoke water discharge permits?"**
    - Statutory is 4 months but may be longer; helps plan project timeline

14. **"If we commission the pre-application service at £[X], how much of this fee is recoverable against the subsequent application?"**
    - Confirm cost offset mechanism

### 2.4 Alternative Options Questions

15. **"If surface water discharge proves infeasible, would discharge to foul sewer be acceptable as an alternative, and would we need a Trade Effluent Consent from Yorkshire Water?"**
    - Important backup option to explore in parallel

16. **"Are there any other regulatory routes or exemptions we should consider?"**
    - Double-check no exemptions have been missed

## 5. EXPECTED OUTCOMES FROM PRE-APPLICATION CONSULTATION

### What You Should Receive:

1. **Written advice report** covering:
   - Feasibility of proposed discharge
   - Permit type and application route
   - Required supporting assessments
   - Recommended baseline monitoring programme
   - Likely consent conditions
   - Any fundamental obstacles or concerns
   - Application process and timeline

2. **Site-specific recommendations**:
   - Watercourse suitability assessment
   - Protected sites screening outcome
   - Drainage segregation requirements for pharmaceutical site
   - Any alternative approaches to consider

3. **Action plan**:
   - Prioritized list of next steps
   - Recommended specialist consultants/assessments
   - Timeline to formal application

### Red Flags to Listen For:

**If EA says any of these, you may have a problem:**

- "The receiving watercourse is very small and may not have adequate dilution capacity" → May need alternative discharge route
- "This waterbody is already failing under WFD" → Higher burden of proof that discharge won't worsen status
- "Hydrological connection to [protected site] means HRA will be required" → Additional assessment cost and complexity
- "We would need substantial evidence regarding pharmaceutical drainage segregation" → May need physical modifications to site drainage

### Best Case Outcome:

EA confirms:
- ✓ Discharge is feasible subject to consent conditions
- ✓ Bespoke permit required with reasonable evidence requirements
- ✓ No HRA required (or only simple screening)
- ✓ Watercourse has adequate low flow for dilution
- ✓ Standard monitoring programme acceptable
- ✓ Clear path to application within 6-12 months

### Worst Case Outcome:

EA indicates:
- ✗ Receiving watercourse insufficient for discharge
- ✗ Protected site issues create major obstacles
- ✗ Pharmaceutical site proximity creates unresolvable contamination risk concerns
- **→ In this case, pivot to foul sewer discharge option (Trade Effluent Consent route)**

## 7. PARALLEL ACTIONS TO CONSIDER

**While awaiting EA pre-application response, you can:**

### 7.1 Contact Yorkshire Water (Foul Sewer Alternative)

In case surface water discharge proves infeasible:

- **Contact**: Yorkshire Water Trade Effluent Team (0800 707 6593)
- **Ask about**: Trade Effluent Consent for RO concentrate discharge to foul sewer
- **Provide**: Discharge volume (15,634 L/day) and predicted quality
- **Question**: Is this volume and quality acceptable? What are consent conditions and costs?

This gives you a backup option and negotiating position.

### 7.2 Preliminary Site Work

- **Watercourse photography**: Take comprehensive photos now (季節al comparison useful)
- **Drainage survey**: Confirm site drainage routes and separation from production areas
- **RO system specification**: Finalize equipment selection to confirm actual discharge quality

### 7.3 Internal Planning

- **Project budget refinalization**: Based on EAPermit.md cost estimates (£60-100k total)
- **Project timeline**: Plan assuming 9-12 months to permit, plus construction time
- **Risk assessment**: Document environmental risks and mitigation (COSHH, spill response, etc.)
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Brief senior management on process and timeline

## 8. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

**To maximize chances of successful pre-application consultation:**

1. **Be comprehensive**: Provide all requested information upfront; incomplete submissions delay advice
2. **Be transparent**: Disclose pharmaceutical operations and drainage honestly; EA will find out anyway
3. **Be specific**: Vague descriptions get vague advice; specific technical details get specific guidance
4. **Show environmental awareness**: Demonstrate you've considered environmental impacts and alternatives
5. **Ask smart questions**: Questions in Section 2 show you understand the regulatory framework
6. **Take notes**: EA verbal advice is valuable; capture everything for reference
7. **Follow up in writing**: After meeting, email case officer summarizing your understanding of advice received

**Critical success factor**: The receiving watercourse flow capacity is the fundamental constraint. If EA indicates concerns about this, immediately discuss the Yorkshire Water foul sewer alternative.

---

## 9. ESTIMATED TIMELINE

| Stage | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Pre-app request preparation | 1-2 weeks | Gathering info and documents |
| EA initial review | 4-6 weeks | After submission and payment |
| Consultation meeting | 1 day | Virtual or site visit |
| EA written advice report | 2-3 weeks | After meeting |
| **Total to receiving advice** | **2-3 months** | From starting preparation |

Plan that pre-application consultation will take 2-3 months. This is time and money well spent to avoid £20,000+ in potentially abortive work on a fundamentally flawed approach.
