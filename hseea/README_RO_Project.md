# RO Concentrate Discharge Project - Documentation Index

**Project**: Reverse Osmosis Water Purification with Concentrate Discharge
**Location**: Near Barmby Moor, Pocklington, England
**Date Created**: 29 October 2025

---

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing a reverse osmosis (RO) water purification system at our pharmaceutical manufacturing site. The purified water will be used in operations, and the RO concentrate (reject water) needs to be discharged to a local watercourse.

**Key Parameters:**
- Feed water: Up to 100,000 litres/day potable water (mains supply)
- RO recovery rate: ~65%
- Concentrate output: ~35,000 litres/day
- Proposed discharge: Local stream near Barmby Moor
- Site type: Pharmaceutical manufacturing (SIC 21.20)

## Critical Next Actions

### PRIORITY 1: EA Pre-Application Consultation
**Cost**: £2,000-£3,000 (recoverable against permit application fee)
**Timeline**: 2-3 months to receive advice
**Why**: Confirms feasibility and prevents £20,000+ in potentially abortive work

**Steps:**
1. ✓ Review PreApp.md document
2. Complete information gathering checklist (PreApp.md Section 1)
3. Fill out quick reference template (PreApp.md Appendix A)
4. Call EA on **03708 506 506** to initiate pre-application request
5. Prepare and submit formal request with supporting documents
6. Attend consultation meeting
7. Receive and review EA written advice

### PRIORITY 2: Identify Receiving Watercourse
**Critical information needed before EA consultation:**
- Official watercourse name (may be "Unnamed Drain")
- Grid reference of proposed discharge point
- WFD waterbody designation
- Visual assessment of flow and characteristics
- Distance to next named watercourse
- Photographs of stream at discharge location

**Resources:**
- OS Explorer Map 294 (Market Weighton & Yorkshire Wolds Central)
- Magic Map: https://magic.defra.gov.uk/
- Grid Reference Finder: https://gridreferencefinder.com/
- Site visit with camera

### PRIORITY 3: Feed Water Quality Data
**Obtain from Yorkshire Water:**
- Annual Water Quality Report for your supply zone
- Contact: Yorkshire Water customer services
- Key parameters: pH, TDS/conductivity, hardness, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, sodium

**Alternative**: Commission independent analysis (£200-£400)

### PRIORITY 4: Backup Option Investigation
**Contact Yorkshire Water Trade Effluent Team in parallel:**
- Phone: **0800 707 6593**
- Ask about: Trade Effluent Consent for RO concentrate discharge to foul sewer
- Volume: 35,000 L/day
- Get: Feasibility, costs, consent conditions

**Why**: If surface water discharge proves infeasible due to low stream flow, foul sewer may be cheaper and simpler alternative.

## Key Decision Points

### Decision Point 1: Proceed with Surface Water Discharge?
**Timing**: After EA pre-application advice received (2-3 months)
**Criteria**:
- ✓ EA confirms watercourse has adequate dilution capacity
- ✓ No fundamental protected sites obstacles
- ✓ Reasonable evidence requirements for pharmaceutical site
- ✓ Achievable consent conditions and monitoring requirements

**If NO**: Pivot to foul sewer discharge via Yorkshire Water Trade Effluent Consent route

### Decision Point 2: Commission Detailed Assessments?
**Timing**: After EA specifies requirements in pre-app advice
**Potential requirements**:
- Watercourse flow monitoring (£2,000-£5,000, 4-12 weeks)
- WFD compliance assessment (£3,000-£8,000)
- Ecological impact assessment (£4,000-£10,000)
- HRA screening (£2,000-£5,000 if required)

**Criteria**: Only proceed if Decision Point 1 outcome is positive

### Decision Point 3: Submit Formal Permit Application?
**Timing**: After all required assessments completed (6-9 months from start)
**Investment at this point**: ~£15,000-£30,000 already spent
**Application fee**: £16,100 (bespoke water discharge activity)
**Criteria**:
- ✓ All assessments show discharge is achievable
- ✓ EA pre-app advice was generally positive
- ✓ Budget approved for full project (£60-100k total)

## Risk Register

### HIGH RISKS

**Risk 1: Insufficient Watercourse Dilution Capacity**
- Impact: Project infeasible for surface water discharge
- Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH (unnamed drain near Barmby Moor likely small)
- Mitigation: Early EA pre-app advice, parallel foul sewer investigation
- Contingency: Pivot to Yorkshire Water Trade Effluent Consent route

**Risk 2: Protected Sites Hydrological Connection**
- Impact: HRA required, increased scrutiny, potential refusal
- Probability: MEDIUM (Lower Derwent Valley SAC/SPA is nearby)
- Mitigation: Early desktop screening, EA pre-app advice
- Contingency: Detailed HRA or pivot to foul sewer

**Risk 3: Pharmaceutical Site Contamination Concerns**
- Impact: EA requires extensive evidence of drainage segregation, possible refusal
- Probability: MEDIUM (pharmaceutical manufacturing always triggers scrutiny)
- Mitigation: Clear drainage segregation evidence, site visit with EA
- Contingency: Physical drainage modifications or pivot to foul sewer

### MEDIUM RISKS

**Risk 4: WFD Waterbody Already Failing**
- Impact: Higher burden of proof, more detailed assessments required
- Probability: MEDIUM (many small watercourses failing under WFD)
- Mitigation: High-quality WFD assessment demonstrating no deterioration
- Contingency: Enhanced treatment of concentrate or pivot to foul sewer

**Risk 5: Cost Overruns**
- Impact: Project budget exceeded
- Probability: MEDIUM (assessments often more complex than anticipated)
- Mitigation: 20% contingency included, phased decision points
- Contingency: Value engineering, reduced scope, or project pause

**Risk 6: Timeline Extensions**
- Impact: Operational start date delayed
- Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH (EA determination often exceeds 4 months)
- Mitigation: Early engagement, high-quality application, responsive to EA queries
- Contingency: Temporary alternative water source or delayed operations

### LOW RISKS

**Risk 7: Planning Permission Required for RO Installation**
- Impact: Additional consent process, 2-3 month delay

## Questions & Answers Log

### Session 1: 29 October 2025

**Q: Do we need an EA permit for RO concentrate discharge to a stream?**
A: YES. Bespoke Water Discharge Activity Permit required under EPR 2016. No exemptions available for this discharge type and volume.

**Q: What tests are required?**
A: See EAPermit.md Section 2. Key requirements:
- Feed water characterization (Yorkshire Water data or independent testing)
- Receiving watercourse baseline monitoring (water quality and flow)
- Predicted concentrate composition calculations
- Ongoing effluent and receiving water monitoring post-consent

**Q: What treatment is needed for concentrate before discharge?**
A: See EAPermit.md Section 3. Likely minimal treatment required (RO concentrate from potable feed is relatively clean), but may need:
- pH adjustment if outside 6-9 range
- Flow balancing/attenuation if instantaneous discharge rate too high
- Temperature control if elevated
- Specific requirements will be defined by EA in discharge consent conditions

**Q: What do we need for successful permit application?**
A: See EAPermit.md Section 4. Comprehensive list includes:
- Completed application forms
- Site plans and process diagrams
- WFD compliance assessment
- Ecological impact assessment
- Watercourse flow monitoring data
- Mixing zone calculations
- Drainage segregation evidence (pharmaceutical site-specific)
- Environmental management system documentation

**Q: How much will this cost?**
A: See Budget Summary above.
- Total capital: £60,000-£100,000
- Annual ongoing: £7,000-£15,000

**Q: What preparation is needed for EA pre-application consultation?**
A: See PreApp.md for complete preparation guide. Key actions:
- Identify receiving watercourse properly (official name, grid ref, WFD designation)
- Gather site details and operational specifications
- Obtain feed water quality data
- Prepare site plans and process description
- Develop list of questions for EA
- Prepare formal pre-app request letter

## Notes

- This documentation was prepared by Claude Code AI assistant based on EA permit requirements research
- All advice is general guidance only and does not constitute professional environmental consultancy
- Formal advice should be obtained from qualified environmental consultants and the Environment Agency
- Regulatory requirements and guidance may change - always verify current requirements with EA
- Cost and timeline estimates are indicative and may vary based on site-specific factors

**IMPORTANT**: The EA pre-application advice service is strongly recommended before significant investment. The £2,000-£3,000 cost can prevent much larger expenditure on a potentially infeasible approach.

**Good luck with your project. Start with the EA pre-application consultation - it's the critical first step.**
