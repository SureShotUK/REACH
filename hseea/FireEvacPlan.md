# Fire Evacuation Plan — All Employees

## 1. Legal Basis

Every employee has a duty under
<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/7" target="_blank">Section 7 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>
to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and others at work.

This evacuation plan forms part of the fire safety arrangements required by the responsible person under the
<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" target="_blank">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a>.
The following articles are directly relevant to employees:

| Article | Relevance to Employees |
|---------|------------------------|
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/14/made" target="_blank">Article 14</a> | Emergency routes and exits must be kept clear and usable at all times |
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/15/made" target="_blank">Article 15</a> | Employees must follow evacuation procedures when instructed |
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/19/made" target="_blank">Article 19</a> | Employees must be informed of, and familiar with, evacuation procedures |
| <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/21/made" target="_blank">Article 21</a> | Employees must participate in fire safety training and drills |

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This document sets out the steps every employee must follow when a fire alarm is activated and an evacuation is required. It applies to all employees, visitors, and contractors on the premises.

Fire marshals have a separate, more detailed plan covering their specific zone duties. If you are a fire marshal, refer to the **Fire Marshal Evacuation Plan** alongside this document.

## 3. Know Your Building

Before an evacuation is needed, every employee should be familiar with the following:

| Item | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Your nearest exit | You may not be able to use your usual way out |
| A secondary exit route | Your primary route may be blocked by fire or smoke |
| The assembly point | You must go directly there on evacuation |
| Fire alarm call points in your area | You may need to raise the alarm |
| Any vulnerable persons in your immediate area | You may be in a position to assist |

If you are unsure about any of the above, speak to your fire marshal or manager. A diagram of the assembly point and the evacuation route is at the top of the next page.

## 4. If You Discover a Fire

If you become aware of a fire — for example, you see flames, smell smoke, or notice unusual heat — act as follows:

1. **Stay calm.** Do not panic. Act quickly but deliberately.
2. **Raise the alarm immediately.** Press the nearest fire alarm call point. If you cannot safely reach one, leave the building and call **999** directly, or report the fire to a fire marshal.
3. **Warn others.** Shout to alert anyone nearby so they can begin to evacuate.
4. **Do not attempt to fight the fire unless you have been trained to do so.** If you have received fire extinguisher training and the fire is very small and contained, you may tackle it — but only if you can do so safely without blocking your escape route. Never delay your evacuation to fight a fire.
5. **Evacuate.** Once you have raised the alarm, follow the steps in Sections 5 and 6 of this plan to leave the building safely.
6. **Report the fire.** At the assembly point, tell the Head Fire Marshal or assembly point warden the location of the fire and what you observed. This information will be passed to the fire and rescue service.

## 5. When You Hear the Alarm

1. **Assume it is a genuine emergency.** Do not ignore the alarm or assume it is a test unless you have been formally informed in advance by an authorised person.
2. **Stop work immediately.** Do not delay your evacuation to finish a task or shut down equipment, unless the equipment can be isolated safely and without slowing your exit.
3. **Do not collect personal belongings.** Do not waste time retrieving coats, bags, phones, or other items. Nothing is worth the risk.
4. **Remain calm and walk briskly.** Do not run — this increases the risk of falls and can cause panic among others.

## 6. Leaving the Building

1. Move towards your **nearest safe exit**. Follow the green evacuation route signs displayed throughout the building.
2. If your nearest exit is blocked or unsafe, use your **secondary exit route**. If that is also blocked, seek guidance from a fire marshal.
3. **Close all doors behind you** as you leave. Do not lock them. Closed doors significantly slow the spread of fire and smoke.
4. Do not **prop fire doors open** or wedge them in any way. Fire doors are designed to contain fire and smoke — leaving them open removes this protection.
5. If you pass a **fire alarm call point** and you are aware of a fire, press it as you leave — but do not delay or backtrack your evacuation to do so.
6. Follow any instructions given to you by fire marshals. They are responsible for guiding occupants safely out of the building.

## 7. If You Encounter Smoke or Fire

1. If you encounter smoke, **stay as low as possible.** Crawl on your hands and knees if necessary — the air near the floor will be significantly cleaner and more breathable.
2. If your route is blocked by fire or heavy smoke, **do not attempt to pass through it.** Turn back and find an alternative exit route.
3. If you become trapped in a room and cannot safely reach an exit:
    - **Close the door** to slow the entry of smoke.
    - Signal for help from a window if one is available.
    - Stay low until help arrives.

## 8. Helping Others

1. If you notice a **vulnerable person** — for example, someone with a mobility or sensory impairment, a pregnant colleague, or a visitor unfamiliar with the building — offer to guide them towards the exit.
2. If you are aware of a **visitor or contractor** on the premises, guide them towards the nearest exit and on to the assembly point.
3. **Do not put yourself at serious risk** to assist others. If conditions are dangerous, proceed to the assembly point and report the concern to a fire marshal or the Head Fire Marshal immediately.

---

## 9. At the Assembly Point

1. Proceed directly to the **designated assembly point.** Do not linger near the building or move to a different location.
2. Stay with your **department or team group** so that you can be accounted for in the headcount.
3. **Participate in the headcount** when asked by a fire marshal or the assembly point warden.
4. If you are aware of anyone on the premises who has **not yet evacuated**, report this to a fire marshal immediately.
5. Keep the area around the building entrances clear. Do not cluster near the exits — this blocks the route for anyone still evacuating.

## 10. Waiting for the All-Clear

1. **Do not re-enter the building** under any circumstances until the fire and rescue service or the Head Fire Marshal has formally confirmed it is safe to do so.
2. Remain at the assembly point and stay calm. The fire and rescue service will be contacted and will advise when it is safe to return.
3. Once the all-clear has been given, re-enter the building in an orderly manner and return to your workplace only if instructed to do so.

## 11. Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Is Dangerous |
|---------|---------------------|
| Assuming the alarm is a false alarm | Delays evacuation and puts lives at risk |
| Going back for personal belongings | Wastes critical time and increases exposure to fire and smoke |
| Running | Increases the risk of falls and can cause panic |
| Propping fire doors open | Allows fire and smoke to spread freely through the building |
| Blocking the area near building exits | Prevents others from evacuating safely |
| Re-entering the building before the all-clear | The building may still contain fire, smoke, or structural hazards |
| Attempting to fight a fire without training | Risks serious burns and delays evacuation, putting you and others in danger |

## 12. Training and Drills

All employees are required to participate in fire evacuation drills. These are carried out at regular intervals to ensure that everyone on the premises is familiar with the procedure and can carry it out calmly and efficiently.

If you have not been briefed on this evacuation plan, or if you have any questions about any part of it, speak to your fire marshal or manager.
