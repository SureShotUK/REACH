# Noise Assessment Report

**Date of Measurements:** [DD/MM/YYYY]
**Date of Report:** [DD/MM/YYYY]
**Prepared by:** [Name / Role]
**Site:** [Site Name]
**Noise Source:** Area 3 — fixed machinery (not reducible at source)

---

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the results of a noise level survey carried out at [site name] to identify areas where noise levels may require action under the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 (CNAWR 2005). Measurements were taken across nine areas of the site. The primary noise source is machinery located in Area 3, which has been confirmed as not capable of further noise reduction at source.

The machinery in Area 3 operates for approximately 4 hours per day; when switched off, noise levels across the site return to low ambient levels. During the machine's operating period, workers fall into two categories: those working in Area 5, and the machine operator who moves between several areas as part of their duties. Breaks are taken in a separate quiet building. This assessment covers both worker types.

This assessment forms part of the employer's duty under Regulation 5 of CNAWR 2005 to assess the risks to employees from noise at work.

## 2. Legal Framework

<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1643/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">Regulation 4 of the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1643)</a> sets the following exposure thresholds based on daily personal noise exposure LEP,d (8-hour time-weighted average) and peak sound pressure level LCpeak:

| Threshold | Daily Noise Exposure LEP,d | Peak Sound Pressure LCpeak | HPD Attenuation Counted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lower exposure action value | 80 dB(A) | 135 dB(C) | No |
| Upper exposure action value | 85 dB(A) | 137 dB(C) | No |
| Exposure limit value | 87 dB(A) | 140 dB(C) | Yes |

**Note:** The lower and upper action values are assessed against noise exposure levels *without* hearing protection. The exposure limit value of 87 dB(A) is the only threshold that accounts for the noise reduction provided by hearing protection worn (Regulation 4(5)).

**Key legal duties triggered by these thresholds:**

- **At or above 80 dB(A) (lower action value):** Assess and record noise risks. Reduce exposure so far as reasonably practicable. Make hearing protection available. Provide information and training on noise risks. Provide health surveillance (audiometric testing) under Regulation 9.

- **At or above 85 dB(A) (upper action value):** Implement a programme of organisational and technical measures to reduce exposure (Regulation 6). Hearing protection must be provided and its use enforced (Regulation 7). Hearing protection zones must be established and signed.

- **At or above 87 dB(A) (limit value, after HPD):** Exposure must not exceed this level under any circumstances. This is the absolute limit on the noise reaching the worker's ears after hearing protection is accounted for.

## 3. Measurement Details

### 3.1 Equipment

Measurements were carried out using a **Martindale SP79** integrating sound level meter, classified as **IEC Class 2** under BS EN 61672. Class 2 instruments carry a measurement uncertainty of **±1.5 dB** under reference conditions. This classification is suitable for screening surveys and preliminary assessments. Where a formal enforcement-standard assessment is required, a **Class 1** instrument (±0.7 dB uncertainty) should be used.

### 3.2 Procedure

At each of the nine measurement locations, the sound level meter was operated over a continuous **5-minute period**. The minimum and maximum instantaneous values were recorded for A-weighted (dB(A)) readings. The measurement was then repeated to record the minimum and maximum instantaneous values for C-weighted (dB(C)) readings.

### 3.3 Limitations

1. **Short-duration snapshots.** The HSE action and limit values are based on 8-hour time-weighted average exposure (LEP,d). The 5-minute measurements in this report are not equivalent to LEP,d. Section 5.2 estimates likely 8-hour TWA doses using reported working patterns, but these should be regarded as indicative only.

2. **Min/max, not Leq.** Only the minimum and maximum levels during each 5-minute period were recorded; the equivalent continuous level (Leq) over the measurement period was not captured. The dose estimates in Section 5.2 therefore use maximum levels, producing a conservative (worst-case) result.

3. **Measurement uncertainty.** Actual noise levels may be up to 1.5 dB higher than recorded values due to the Class 2 instrument tolerance.

4. **Representative conditions.** Noise levels may vary with machinery loading, production schedules, or other operational factors. The measurements represent conditions at the time of survey only.

## 4. Measurement Results

The following table presents the recorded noise levels at each of the nine survey locations. All values are in dB.

| Area | dB(A) Min | dB(A) Max | dB(C) Min | dB(C) Max |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 84.7 | 87.4 | 84.5 | 91.8 |
| 2 | 80.2 | 88.1 | 86.9 | 90.9 |
| 3 | 82.1 | 91.9 | 89.5 | 98.7 |
| 4 | 79.0 | 82.0 | 81.6 | 85.0 |
| 5 | 78.4 | 80.8 | 78.3 | 84.5 |

## 5. Analysis

### 5.1 Instantaneous Levels — Comparison to Action Values

The maximum measured dB(A) at each location is compared below against the lower action value (80 dB(A)) and the upper action value (85 dB(A)). The possible upper bound of each measurement, accounting for the ±1.5 dB Class 2 uncertainty, is also shown.

| Area | dB(A) Max Measured | Upper Bound (+1.5 dB) | ≥ 80 dB(A)? | ≥ 85 dB(A)? |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 87.4 | 88.9 | Yes | Yes |
| 2 | 88.1 | 89.6 | Yes | Yes |
| 3 | 91.9 | 93.4 | Yes | Yes |
| 4 | 82.0 | 83.5 | Yes | No |
| 5 | 80.8 | 82.3 | Yes | No |
| 6 | 77.3 | 78.8 | No | No |
| 7 | 74.4 | 75.9 | No | No |
| 8 | 68.8 | 70.3 | No | No |
| 9 | 64.1 | 65.6 | No | No |

- **Areas 1–5** exceed the lower exposure action value of 80 dB(A).
- **Areas 1–3** exceed the upper exposure action value of 85 dB(A).

### 5.2 Estimated 8-Hour Time-Weighted Average (TWA) Dose

The regulations assess exposure on the basis of LEP,d — the equivalent continuous noise level over an 8-hour working day. Two worker types have been assessed based on the reported working pattern: the **machine operator** and the **Area 5 worker**. Both work in quieter areas after the machine shuts down, and take breaks in a separate quiet building.

**Calculation method:** Equal energy principle (3 dB doubling rule), as prescribed by the regulations:

> LEP,d = 10 × log₁₀ \[ Σ (tᵢ / T) × 10^(Lᵢ/10) \]
>
> where T = 480 minutes (8-hour shift), tᵢ = time spent at noise level Lᵢ

**Common assumptions:**

- The machine operates for 4 hours (240 minutes) per day. When switched off, noise levels across the site return to low ambient levels (assumed 60 dB(A)).
- Remaining shift time after machine shutdown: 180 minutes of quiet work at 60 dB(A).
- Breaks: approximately 60 minutes total in a separate quiet building. With up to 3 workers conversing, break area noise is estimated at 65 dB(A).
- Maximum measured dB(A) values have been used for each area (worst-case basis).
- These estimates do not account for hearing protection.

#### Machine Operator

The machine operator's duties involve a repeating cycle during the 4-hour operating period. Based on the described working pattern, one cycle comprises approximately:

| Area | Time per cycle | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | 3–4 min | Primary working position |
| 2 | ~15 sec | Brief pass-through |
| 3 | ~15 sec | Brief pass-through |
| 4 | ~1 min | Occasional — averaged to ~0.5 min per cycle |
| 8 | 2–4 min | Between tasks |

Using mid-range values (3.5 min in Area 1, 3 min in Area 8), each cycle is approximately 7.5 minutes. Over the 240-minute operating period this gives approximately 32 repeating cycles with the following total time breakdown:

| Location | dB(A) Max | Total Time | Fraction of 8-hr shift |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| Area 1 | 87.4 | 112 min | 0.233 |
| Area 2 | 88.1 | 8 min | 0.017 |
| Area 3 | 91.9 | 8 min | 0.017 |
| Area 4 | 82.0 | 16 min | 0.033 |
| Area 8 | 68.8 | 96 min | 0.200 |
| Quiet work (machine off) | 60 | 180 min | 0.375 |
| Breaks | 65 | 60 min | 0.125 |

**Estimated LEP,d (Machine Operator): 82.4 dB(A)**

This exceeds the lower action value of 80 dB(A) but is below the upper action value of 85 dB(A). Varying the time in Area 1 across the stated 3–4 minute range changes the result by approximately ±1 dB, giving an overall range of **81.6–83.1 dB(A)**. The conclusion — above the lower action value, below the upper action value — holds across the entire range.

#### Area 5 Worker

The Area 5 worker remains in Area 5 for the duration of the machine's 4-hour operating period, then moves to a quieter area for the remainder of the shift.

| Location | dB(A) Max | Total Time | Fraction of 8-hr shift |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| Area 5 | 80.8 | 240 min | 0.500 |
| Quiet work (machine off) | 60 | 180 min | 0.375 |
| Breaks | 65 | 60 min | 0.125 |

**Estimated LEP,d (Area 5 Worker): 77.8 dB(A)**

This is below the lower action value of 80 dB(A). Even accounting for the ±1.5 dB Class 2 measurement uncertainty on the Area 5 reading (raising the level to a maximum of 82.3 dB(A)), the resulting LEP,d would be approximately 79.3 dB(A) — still below the lower action value.

### 5.3 Peak Sound Pressure Levels

The highest measured dB(C) value across all areas is **98.7 dB(C) in Area 3**. This is well below the lower peak sound pressure action value of **135 dB(C)** and the peak limit value of **140 dB(C)**.

**No action is required with respect to peak sound pressure levels.**

### 5.4 Low-Frequency Content

A significant difference between dB(C) and dB(A) maximum readings is observed in the more distant areas from the noise source:

| Area | dB(A) Max | dB(C) Max | dB(C) − dB(A) |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 7 | 74.4 | 82.3 | 7.9 |
| 8 | 68.8 | 83.3 | 14.5 |
| 9 | 64.1 | 84.2 | 20.1 |

A-weighting attenuates low frequencies; C-weighting provides a flatter frequency response. A large dB(C)–dB(A) difference therefore indicates **significant low-frequency noise content**. This is consistent with low-frequency noise generated by machinery in Area 3 propagating through the building structure.

Low-frequency noise attenuates poorly with distance and is resistant to conventional acoustic barriers. This must be taken into account when selecting engineering controls (see Section 7.2).

## 6. Findings Summary

1. **Machine operator:** Estimated LEP,d of **82.4 dB(A)** (range 81.6–83.1 dB(A)), which exceeds the lower action value of 80 dB(A). This is below the upper action value of 85 dB(A) and well below the limit value of 87 dB(A). The duties triggered at the lower action value apply to this worker type.

2. **Area 5 worker:** Estimated LEP,d of **77.8 dB(A)**, which is below the lower action value of 80 dB(A). No exposure action value duties are triggered at this level. The instantaneous maximum recorded in Area 5 (80.8 dB(A)) does briefly exceed 80 dB(A), but this does not affect the 8-hour TWA assessment.

3. The upper action value of 85 dB(A) is **not exceeded** by either worker type. The mandatory noise reduction programme (Regulation 6) and mandatory HPD enforcement duties are therefore not triggered.

4. **Peak sound pressure levels are well within limits** across all areas. No action is required for peaks.

5. **Significant low-frequency noise propagation** is occurring from Area 3 into more distant areas, as evidenced by elevated dB(C) readings in Areas 7–9. This should be considered if engineering controls are pursued.

6. The noise source in Area 3 is confirmed as not reducible at source. The current working pattern — which limits time in the highest-noise areas to seconds per cycle — is effective in keeping the machine operator's LEP,d below the upper action value.

---

## 7. Recommendations

The following recommendations address the legal duties triggered by the findings and include good-practice measures where appropriate. Recommendations are grouped by the hierarchy of controls. Elimination and substitution of the noise source are not applicable, as the machinery in Area 3 cannot be made quieter.

**Compliance position summary:** The machine operator's estimated exposure exceeds the lower action value, triggering duties under Regulations 5 (assessment), 7 (hearing protection availability), 8 (record keeping), and 9 (health surveillance). The upper action value is not exceeded, so the mandatory noise reduction programme under Regulation 6 and mandatory HPD enforcement under Regulation 7(2) are not triggered. The Area 5 worker's estimated exposure is below the lower action value; no specific regulatory duties are triggered for this role at the current estimated level, though this should be confirmed by formal dosimetry.

### 7.1 Commission Full-Shift Personal Dosimetry

The 5-minute screening measurements in this report are not a formal noise dose assessment. To satisfy the documentation requirements of Regulation 8 and to confirm the estimated LEP,d values, **personal noise dosimeters should be worn by workers covering both the machine operator and Area 5 roles, over complete 8-hour shifts**.

This is particularly important for the Area 5 worker, whose estimated LEP,d of 77.8 dB(A) is relatively close to the lower action value. If formal dosimetry confirms LEP,d at or above 80 dB(A) for this role, the full set of lower action value duties would then apply to Area 5 workers.

### 7.2 Engineering Controls — Noise Reduction in Area 1

The employer has a duty under Regulation 6 to reduce noise exposure so far as reasonably practicable (SFAIRP), regardless of whether the upper action value is exceeded. The machine operator spends approximately half of the 4-hour noisy period in **Area 1**, which is the dominant contributor to their estimated LEP,d. Reducing noise levels in Area 1 is therefore the single most effective engineering measure available.

Options to investigate:

- **Sound-absorbing treatment** in Area 1 (e.g. acoustic ceiling panels, wall-mounted absorbers) to reduce reflected noise and lower the ambient level.
- **Acoustic barriers or screens** between Area 1 and the noise source. Note: the significant low-frequency content identified in Section 5.4 means lightweight barriers are unlikely to be effective — heavier barriers or specialist low-frequency absorption may be needed.
- **Acoustic treatment of the propagation path** between Areas 3 and 1, if the physical layout permits.

An acoustic specialist should be consulted if low-frequency noise control is to be addressed effectively.

### 7.3 Administrative Controls

The current working pattern already limits time in the highest-noise areas (Areas 2 and 3) to a few seconds per cycle, which is effective in keeping the machine operator's LEP,d well below the upper action value. To maintain this position:

- **Formalise and document the current working pattern** so that it is maintained consistently and is not altered on an ad hoc basis.
- **Ensure no worker spends extended periods in Areas 2 or 3.** If operational requirements change, this noise assessment must be reviewed before any change to the pattern is implemented.
- **Restrict access** to Areas 1–3 to those workers who require it for their duties.

### 7.4 Hearing Protection

**Machine operator (LEP,d above lower action value):** Hearing protection **must be made available** under Regulation 7. The operator spends significant time in Area 1 where maximum measured levels reach 87.4 dB(A), so use of hearing protection in Areas 1, 2, and 3 should be strongly encouraged.

**Area 5 worker (LEP,d below lower action value):** Hearing protection is not a legal requirement at the current estimated exposure level. It is, however, good practice to make it available, given that instantaneous levels in Area 5 briefly exceed 80 dB(A).

Selection requirements:

- Hearing protection should be suitable for the noise spectrum present. Given the low-frequency content identified in Section 5.4, ear muffs with adequate low-frequency attenuation should be considered.
- Workers must be instructed on correct fitting and use.

### 7.5 Health Surveillance

Regulation 9 requires health surveillance where employees are likely to be regularly exposed at or above the lower action value of 80 dB(A).

**Machine operator:** Must be enrolled in a health surveillance programme, comprising:

- A **baseline audiometric test** at or before the start of regular exposure.
- **Annual audiometric testing** thereafter.
- Records kept for the duration of employment and for **40 years** after employment ends.

**Area 5 worker:** Health surveillance is not required at the current estimated LEP,d of 77.8 dB(A). If formal dosimetry (Recommendation 7.1) confirms LEP,d at or above 80 dB(A) for this role, the Area 5 worker should then be enrolled.

### 7.6 Information, Training, and Signage

- The machine operator and any worker who may enter Areas 1–5 must receive **information and training** on the health effects of noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus, the controls in place, and the correct use of any hearing protection provided. Delivery of this training must be documented.
- **Noise warning signs** should be displayed at entry points to Areas 1–3 to indicate elevated noise levels and the availability of hearing protection.

---

## 8. Review

This noise assessment should be reviewed and updated:

- Following completion of full-shift personal dosimetry (Recommendation 7.1);
- Following implementation of any engineering or administrative controls, to verify their effectiveness;
- If there is any change to the machinery, site layout, or working patterns;
- At a minimum interval of **every 5 years**, in the absence of other changes.

---

*This assessment was conducted using a Martindale SP79 Class 2 integrating sound level meter. The screening measurements presented here are sufficient to identify the need for action and to guide interim measures. A formal noise dose assessment using full-shift personal dosimetry and, where indicated, a Class 1 instrument is recommended to confirm actual worker exposures and to satisfy the documentation requirements of CNAWR 2005 Regulation 8.*
