# Ladder Compliance Checklist

---

### Initial Setup

- [ ] Confirm ladder status: Is it **genuinely** emergency use only, or is it occasionally used for work access?
- [ ] If occasionally used for work: Apply FULL work ladder requirements (see `General Ladders Compliance.pdf`)
- [ ] Install signage: "Emergency Escape Only - Not for Work Access" + "No Unauthorized Access"
- [ ] Verify ladder complies with **Approved Document B section 3.28**: NOT for public, area not normally occupied, conventional stair impractical
- [ ] Include ladder in fire risk assessment under RRF(SO) 2005
- [ ] Check adequacy of emergency lighting at ladder location
- [ ] Verify emergency exit signage is compliant and visible
- [ ] Confirm ladder access mechanism complies with RRF(SO) (can be immediately opened in emergency)

### Design and Structural Compliance

**For Ladders Installed Post-2005:**
- [ ] Verify ladder complies with BS 4211:2005+A1:2008 or BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016
- [ ] Check rung spacing is 225-300mm
- [ ] Verify minimum width of 300mm between stringers
- [ ] Check clearances: 200mm behind rungs, 600mm on user side
- [ ] For ladders over 2.5m: Safety cage/hoops installed (strongly recommended even if not legally required)
- [ ] For ladders over 9m: Rest platforms provided at suitable intervals (recommended)
- [ ] Top of ladder has adequate landing platform with handholds
- [ ] Building Regulations approval obtained

**For Existing Ladders Installed Pre-2006:**
- [ ] Document original installation date (or best estimate)
- [ ] Confirm no substantial modifications have triggered need for current standards compliance
- [ ] Verify ladder remains structurally sound and safe for emergency use (via structural engineer survey)
- [ ] Maintain records of modification history
- [ ] Ensure any component replacements use appropriate specifications
- [ ] If substantial modifications planned: Determine if current standards will apply (see Section 3)

**All Ladders (Regardless of Installation Date):**
- [ ] Ladder is in safe, serviceable condition
- [ ] No structural deterioration that compromises safety
- [ ] All fixings secure
- [ ] No missing or damaged components
- [ ] Top of ladder has adequate landing platform with handholds
- [ ] Structural engineer confirms safe condition during 5-yearly surveys

### Inspection Program

- [ ] Monthly visual checks established and assigned to responsible person
- [ ] Monthly check records maintained (logbook or electronic)
- [ ] Annual detailed inspection scheduled (every 12 months)
- [ ] Competent person appointed for annual inspections (see `Competent Person Fixed Ladder Inspections.pdf`)
- [ ] Five-yearly structural engineer survey scheduled
- [ ] Qualified structural engineer engaged for 5-yearly surveys
- [ ] Post-event inspection procedure established (triggers defined, responsible person identified)
- [ ] Previous inspection reports retained and accessible

### Maintenance Program

- [ ] Defect reporting procedure established
- [ ] Defects prioritized by severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- [ ] Remedial works scheduled and tracked to completion
- [ ] Preventive maintenance schedule established (cleaning, painting, lubrication)
- [ ] Vegetation control around ladder base
- [ ] Component replacement procedure (ensuring parts meet design specification)
- [ ] Budget allocated for maintenance and structural surveys

### Signage and Emergency Lighting

- [ ] Emergency exit signage installed at ladder base (green/white, directional)
- [ ] Emergency exit signage installed at top platform/landing
- [ ] External signage (if applicable) indicating fire escape
- [ ] All signs illuminated (emergency lighting or photoluminescent)
- [ ] Emergency lighting installed at ladder base, along route, at top platform
- [ ] Emergency lighting operates on mains failure with adequate duration (3+ hours)
- [ ] Emergency lighting included in building's monthly function tests
- [ ] Emergency lighting annual full discharge tests conducted and recorded

### Access and Availability

- [ ] Ladder access kept clear and unobstructed at all times
- [ ] Self-closing gate (if present) operates correctly
- [ ] Access mechanism allows immediate opening in emergency (not locked with key)
- [ ] Area around ladder base kept clear of materials, equipment, vegetation
- [ ] Onward escape route from top of ladder is clear and signed

### Record Keeping

- [ ] Fire risk assessment includes emergency escape ladder
- [ ] Monthly check records maintained
- [ ] Annual inspection reports maintained and accessible
- [ ] Five-yearly structural engineer reports retained
- [ ] Emergency lighting test records maintained
- [ ] Remedial works records maintained (linked to inspection reports)
- [ ] All records readily accessible for fire authority or HSE inspection

### Fire Authority Compliance

- [ ] Fire risk assessment up to date (reviewed annually or after significant changes)
- [ ] Responsible Person identified for RRF(SO) compliance
- [ ] Evidence of "sustained, suitable and sufficient" maintenance program available
- [ ] Ready to demonstrate compliance to fire inspector if inspection occurs

### Ongoing Review

- [ ] Annual review of fire risk assessment (includes assessment of ladder adequacy)
- [ ] Monitoring of any near-misses or incidents involving escape routes
- [ ] Review whether changes in building use/occupancy affect ladder suitability
- [ ] Periodic review of whether ladder remains necessary (e.g., if improved primary means of escape installed)
