# Competent Person for Fixed Ladder Inspections - Qualification Requirements

## Legal Basis

Under the **Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER)**, fixed ladders must be inspected at appropriate intervals by a **competent person**. This document outlines what qualifies someone as competent to carry out detailed visual inspections of fixed ladders.

---

## HSE Definition of "Competent Person"

A **competent person** for fixed ladder inspections is someone who has:

1. **Sufficient knowledge and experience** of the type of equipment being inspected
2. **Necessary level of competence** appropriate to the specific equipment and its use
3. **Information and knowledge** of what to look for during inspection
4. **Ability to recognize** what is acceptable and what constitutes a defect
5. **Been formally assigned** the task of carrying out ladder inspections

## Key Principle: No Prescribed Qualifications

**Important:** HSE does **NOT** require specific qualifications, certifications, or training courses to be a competent person for ladder inspections.

Competence is determined by a **combination** of:
- Training (formal and informal)
- Practical experience
- Theoretical knowledge
- Demonstrated ability

**This means:** A competent employee within your organization can carry out detailed visual inspections - you do not necessarily need to engage external inspectors or certified professionals.

## Assessment of Competence

### How to Determine if Someone is Competent

Employers should assess competence based on:

**Knowledge Assessment:**
- Can they identify the components of a fixed ladder?
- Do they understand relevant regulations and standards?
- Can they explain what constitutes a defect?
- Do they know when to withdraw equipment from service?

**Practical Assessment:**
- Can they conduct a systematic inspection?
- Can they correctly identify defects in practice?
- Can they assess whether defects are critical?
- Can they complete inspection records accurately?

**Experience Verification:**
- What relevant experience do they have?
- Have they conducted inspections under supervision?
- Do they understand the specific workplace context?

### Building Competence

For someone who is not yet competent:

1. **Provide appropriate training** (formal or informal)
2. **Allow supervised inspections** until competent
3. **Review inspection reports** for accuracy
4. **Provide feedback and coaching**
5. **Formally confirm competence** before allowing independent inspections

## Can Internal Employees Be Competent Persons?

**Yes - absolutely.** HSE guidance confirms that a competent person:
- **Can be an employee** within your organization
- Does **NOT need to be external** (though external inspectors may be used)
- Does **NOT require formal certification** (though training is important)
- Should have appropriate knowledge, experience, and training for your specific equipment

**Advantages of Internal Competent Persons:**
- Better familiarity with specific equipment
- Understanding of workplace context and usage patterns
- More frequent and responsive inspections possible
- Cost-effective for organizations with multiple fixed ladders

## Documentation of Competence

While not legally required, it is good practice to document:

**Training Records:**
- Training courses attended
- On-the-job training provided
- Manufacturer's training completed

**Competence Assessment:**
- Date competence was assessed
- Who assessed the person as competent
- Basis for determining competence (knowledge, experience, training)
- Scope of competence (types of ladders they can inspect)

**Ongoing Development:**
- Refresher training provided
- Updates on new regulations or standards
- Review of inspection quality

**Purpose:** Demonstrates due diligence and provides evidence that inspections are carried out by appropriately qualified personnel.

---

## Level of Competence vs. Equipment Complexity

The required level of competence varies with:

### Simple Fixed Ladders
**Example:** Short fixed ladder (under 6m) with cage, used occasionally, good environment

**May be competent with:**
- Basic training on ladder components and defects
- Understanding of HSE guidance
- Supervised experience conducting inspections
- Ability to use inspection checklist

### Complex Fixed Ladders
**Example:** Tall industrial ladder (over 9m) with multiple rest platforms, high frequency use, harsh environment, integrated fall arrest system

**Requires higher competence:**
- More extensive training
- Greater technical knowledge
- Experience with similar complex installations
- Understanding of fall protection systems
- Ability to assess structural integrity

**Employer Responsibility:** Match the competence level to the risk and complexity of the equipment.
