# Fixed Ladder - Occasional Work Use - Legislation and Legal Requirements

## Executive Summary

Fixed ladders used for work access, even occasionally, are subject to the **Work at Height Regulations 2005** (WAHR) and **Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998** (PUWER). This applies to ladders accessed up to 5 times per day for brief inspections or maintenance tasks.

**Key Legal Distinction:** A ladder used for work access has MORE STRINGENT requirements than an emergency escape-only ladder. This includes mandatory risk assessment, justification for ladder use over safer alternatives, user training, and more frequent inspections.

**Critical for Pre-2006 Installations:** Existing ladders installed before 2006 are generally "grandfathered" under design standards applicable at installation, but MUST still meet ongoing safety obligations under WAHR and PUWER.

## 1. PRIMARY LEGISLATION

### Work at Height Regulations 2005 (WAHR)

Primary legislation governing work access ladders in the UK.

**Source:** <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/contents/made" target="_blank">Work at Height Regulations 2005</a>

#### <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">Regulation 4: Organisation and Planning</a>

Every employer must ensure work at height is:
- **Properly planned** - suitable and sufficient measures taken to prevent falls
- **Appropriately supervised** - by competent persons
- **Carried out in a safe manner** - in accordance with Regulations

#### <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/regulation/6/made" target="_blank">Regulation 6: Avoidance of Risks from Work at Height</a>

Work at height must be carried out:
1. **So far as is reasonably practicable, otherwise than at height** (consider eliminating height work)
2. **Where work at height necessary:** Take suitable measures to prevent falls using work equipment under Schedule 2 (collective measures prioritized over personal measures)
3. **Minimize distance and consequences** of a fall where risk cannot be eliminated

**Practical Implication:** You must justify why a fixed ladder is necessary rather than safer alternatives (fixed staircase, platform with full guardrails, etc.).

**Acceptable Justifications:**
- ✓ Space constraints make stairs impractical
- ✓ Infrequent access (stairs disproportionate to use)
- ✓ Cost of alternative manifestly disproportionate to marginal risk reduction
- ✓ Building layout makes stairs impossible without major structural work

#### Schedule 6: Requirements for Particular Work Equipment

**This is part of the Work at Height Regulations 2005** - <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/schedule/6/made" target="_blank">WAHR 2005 Schedule 6</a>

**Part 1: Ladders, Paragraphs 1-9** - Specific requirements for ladder use:

**Paragraph 1:** Ladders may be used "only if use of more suitable work equipment is not justified by reason of the low risk and":
- (a) Short duration of use; OR
- (b) Existing features of the site which cannot be altered

**Paragraph 3:** Every ladder shall:
- (a) Be sufficiently strong and stable for purpose
- (b) Be maintained in efficient working order and good repair
- (c) Be used in such a way that secure handhold and support are available to users at all times

**Paragraph 4:** Fixed ladders 9 metres or more above base:
- Shall, where reasonably practicable, have sufficient safe landing areas or rest platforms at suitable intervals

**Paragraph 5(a):** Fixed ladders used for gaining access:
- Shall extend to sufficient height above place of landing, OR
- Other suitable measures taken to ensure handhold

**Practical Requirements - Specific to 2.5-6m Height:**
- Safety cages, hoops, OR personal fall arrest systems **recommended** for fixed ladders over 2.4m (industry standard per BS 4211/BS EN ISO 14122-4; required to meet general duties under PUWER/HSWA)
- Ladder must extend at least 1m above landing platform OR provide suitable handholds (WAHR Schedule 6 Para 5)
- No requirement for rest platforms in the 2.5-6m range (rest platforms required "where reasonably practicable" over 9m per WAHR Schedule 6 Para 4)

**Practical Implication:** Inspection regime MUST be established and documented.

#### <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/regulation/6/made" target="_blank">Regulation 6: Inspection</a>

Work equipment exposed to conditions causing deterioration liable to result in dangerous situations must be:
- **Inspected at suitable intervals** (frequency depends on use and environment)
- **Inspected after any exceptional circumstances** liable to jeopardize safety (impacts, severe weather, alterations)
- Inspections carried out by **competent person**
- Records kept until next inspection

**Practical Implication:** For occasional use (up to 5 times/day) ladders, detailed inspection typically **6-12 monthly**. More frequent in harsh environments (external, coastal, industrial).

#### <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/regulation/9/made" target="_blank">Regulation 9: Training</a>

Employers must ensure users of work equipment have:
- **Adequate training** for purposes of health and safety including:

## 2. DESIGN STANDARDS - RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

### British Standards for Fixed Ladders

**BS 4211:2005+A1:2008** - Specification for Permanently Fixed Ladders

**BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016** - Safety of Machinery: Fixed Ladders

**Key Specifications:**
- Rung spacing: 225-300 mm
- Rung diameter: 20-35 mm (or equivalent non-circular profile)
- Width between stringers: 300 mm minimum (400 mm preferred)
- Clearance behind rungs: 200 mm minimum
- Clearance on user side: 600 mm minimum
- Load capacity: 1.5 kN per rung, 3 kN per stile

### Pre-2006 Installations - "Grandfathering" Principle

**Critical Clarification for Your Existing Ladder:**

Since your ladder was **installed before 2006**, it is generally "grandfathered" under design standards that applied at time of installation. You are **NOT required** to retrofit the ladder to meet BS 4211:2005+A1:2008 specifications unless substantial modifications are undertaken.

**"Grandfathering" Means:**
- ✓ Design dimensions (rung spacing, clearances, etc.) from original installation remain acceptable
- ✓ No requirement to upgrade to current design standards purely due to passage of time
- ✓ Ladder was compliant when installed and remains acceptable if maintained in safe condition

**HOWEVER - Ongoing Safety Obligations STILL APPLY:**

Even though design standards don't apply retrospectively, you MUST ensure:

1. **Safe Condition (PUWER Reg 5):**
   - Ladder remains structurally sound
   - No deterioration compromising safety
   - Maintained in efficient working order

2. **Suitable for Purpose (PUWER Reg 4):**
   - Adequate for current use (occasional work access, brief inspections)
   - Appropriate for users

3. **Risk Assessment (WAHR Reg 6):**
   - Current risk assessment confirms ladder use is justified
   - Control measures adequate for identified risks

4. **Inspection and Maintenance (PUWER Reg 6):**
   - 6-12 monthly detailed inspections by competent person
   - Pre-use checks by users
   - Records maintained

**When Current Standards MUST Be Applied:**

Your existing pre-2006 ladder MUST comply with current standards (BS 4211:2005+A1:2008 or BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016) if:
- **Substantial modifications** undertaken (adding/modifying safety cage, extending height, replacing major structural components, relocating)
- **Complete replacement** of ladder
- **Major structural upgrades** (converting uncaged to caged, adding rest platforms)

**Minor maintenance does NOT trigger compliance** (painting, rust treatment, individual rung replacement like-for-like, bolt tightening).

## 3. SAFETY FEATURES FOR 2.5-6M HEIGHT RANGE

### Safety Cages / Hoops / Fall Arrest - Industry Practice and General Duties

**Important Clarification:** <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/schedule/6/made" target="_blank">WAHR 2005 Schedule 6</a> does **NOT** specify a requirement for safety cages at 2.4m. Schedule 6 only mentions specific height requirements for **rest platforms at 9m or more**.

**However, safety cages/hoops for ladders over 2.4m are:**

1. **Required by British Standards** (BS 4211:2005+A1:2008 and BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016)
2. **HSE Guidance expectation** for fixed ladders used for work access - see:
   - <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/work-at-height/ladders/index.htm" target="_blank">HSE: Safe Use of Ladders and Stepladders</a>
   - <a href="https://ladderassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LA455-Safe-Use-of-Ladders-and-Stepladders-A-brief-guide.pdf" target="_blank">LA455: Safe Use of Ladders and Stepladders - A Brief Guide (2021)</a> - Jointly published by Ladder Association and HSE (replaces INDG455)
   - <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/work-at-height/index.htm" target="_blank">HSE: Work at Height - Overview</a>
3. **General duty requirement** under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">PUWER Reg 4</a> (suitability) and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/2" target="_blank">HSWA Section 2</a> (general duty of care)

**Industry Standard Practice:**

Fixed ladders over **2.4 metres** used for work access should have ONE of the following:
1. **Safety cages/hoops** (passive fall protection), OR
2. **Personal fall arrest systems** (harness + anchor points)

**Legal Basis:** While not explicitly mandated in WAHR Schedule 6, employers must provide suitable equipment (PUWER Reg 4) and ensure worker safety "so far as is reasonably practicable" (HSWA). For fixed ladders over 2.4m used regularly for work, providing fall protection (cages or fall arrest) is the accepted standard to meet these general duties.

**Practical Considerations:**

**Safety Cages/Hoops (Preferred):**
- ✓ Passive protection - no user action required
- ✓ Suitable for occasional users (no harness training needed)
- ✓ Compatible with brief inspections (no time wasted donning harness)

**Fall Arrest Systems:**
- ✗ Requires users to don harness before each use
- ✗ Requires training in harness use and anchor point attachment
- ✗ Impractical for brief inspections (5 times/day)
- ✗ Higher risk of non-compliance (users may skip harness use)

**For occasional work access (up to 5 times/day, brief inspections), safety cages/hoops are strongly recommended over fall arrest systems.**

**If Your Pre-2006 Ladder Lacks Safety Cage:**

This is a common situation. Options:
1. **Retrofit safety cage** - once installed, triggers compliance with current design standards (substantial modification)
2. **Implement fall arrest system** - requires user training, harness provision, anchor points, inspection regime
3. **Accept higher risk** - document in risk assessment why neither cage nor fall arrest is reasonably practicable (cost disproportionate, structural constraints, etc.) - **this is difficult to justify for regular work access**

**HSE Position & Industry Standard:** Safety cages/hoops are expected for fixed ladders over 2.4m used for work (per BS 4211 and HSE guidance). While not explicitly mandated in WAHR Schedule 6, lack of adequate fall protection on ladders over 2.4m is difficult to justify under general duties (PUWER Reg 4 - suitability, and HSWA Section 2 - duty of care). Strong justification in risk assessment required if neither cage nor fall arrest provided.

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS

### <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/regulation/6/made" target="_blank">WAHR 2005 Regulation 6</a> - Mandatory Risk Assessment

Every employer must conduct risk assessment for work at height activities under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/contents/made" target="_blank">Work at Height Regulations 2005</a>. For fixed ladder use, assessment must address:

#### Hazards
- Falls from height (most significant)
- Falling objects striking persons below
- Structural failure of ladder
- Slips/loss of grip on rungs
- Overreaching causing loss of balance
- Carrying tools/equipment while climbing

#### Risk Factors
- Height of ladder (2.5-6m in your case)
- Frequency of use (up to 5 times/day)
- Duration of work (brief inspections - low risk)
- User competence and training
- Ladder condition and maintenance
- Environmental conditions (weather, lighting, access obstructions)
- Presence of safety cage/hoops (or lack thereof)

#### Control Measures (Hierarchy of Controls)

**Elimination:**
- Could work be done from ground level? (e.g., remote monitoring, extended tools)

**Substitution:**
- Could safer access be provided? (fixed staircase, mobile elevated work platform, scaffolding with guardrails)

**Engineering Controls:**
- Safety cages/hoops on ladder (passive fall protection)
- Adequate handholds at top platform
- Non-slip rungs
- Tool lanyards to prevent dropped objects
- Exclusion zone at base (prevent persons below)

**Administrative Controls:**
- Inspection regime (pre-use checks, detailed inspections 6-12 monthly)
- User training (three points of contact, safe climbing technique)
- Adverse weather restrictions (no use in high winds, ice, heavy rain)
- Permit-to-work system if high-risk activities on platform
- Emergency rescue plan

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
- Fall arrest harness (if no safety cage) - LEAST preferred option
- Hard hat (if risk of falling objects)
- Safety footwear (good grip)
- Gloves (if handling materials)

#### Justification for Ladder Use

**Risk assessment MUST include justification** for ladder use over safer alternatives (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/regulation/6/made" target="_blank">WAHR Reg 6</a> / <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/735/schedule/6/made" target="_blank">Schedule 6 Para 1</a>):

Document:
- ✓ Why fixed staircase is not reasonably practicable (space, cost disproportionate to risk, building constraints)
- ✓ Why MEWP/scaffolding not appropriate (access frequency, setup time disproportionate, cost)
- ✓ Short duration of use (brief inspections, under 30 minutes per visit)
- ✓ Low frequency justifies ladder use (occasional access, up to 5 times/day)
- ✓ Risk acceptably controlled with measures in place (cage, training, inspections)

**Example Justification (adapt to your circumstances):**

> "Fixed ladder provides access to [platform/location] for brief inspections and checks (typically under 30 minutes per visit, up to 5 times per day). Installation of fixed staircase would require significant structural modification costing approximately £[X], which is grossly disproportionate to marginal risk reduction given short duration and low complexity of work. MEWP access would require setup time exceeding inspection time and is impractical for frequent brief access. Risks are acceptably controlled through: safety cage/hoops on ladder, user training, pre-use checks, detailed 6-monthly inspections, and restriction to suitable weather conditions. Based on low risk and short duration, fixed ladder use is justified under WAHR Schedule 6 Para 1."

**Documentation:**
- Risk assessment must be documented (WAHR Reg 4)
- Review annually or after significant changes
- Communicate to all users
- Make available to HSE inspectors

- Ladder identification/location
- Condition of each component
- Defects identified with severity rating (critical/high/medium/low)
- Remedial actions required
- Deadline for completion of remedial actions
- Confirmation when remedial actions completed

**Action if Defects Found:**
- **Critical defects** (structural damage, missing components, unsafe): Take ladder out of service immediately, install barrier and signage, arrange immediate repair/replacement
- **Non-critical defects** (minor corrosion, worn paint): Schedule remedial action, re-inspect after completion

### C. Post-Event Inspection

**Frequency:** After any event liable to jeopardize safety

**Legal Basis:** <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/regulation/6/made" target="_blank">PUWER 1998 Regulation 6(3)</a>

**Triggering Events:**
- Impact damage (vehicle collision, dropped object striking ladder)

## 6. COMPETENT PERSON REQUIREMENTS

### Who Can Conduct Detailed Inspections?

A **competent person** for fixed ladder inspections must have:

1. **Knowledge:** Understanding of ladder types, structural components, deterioration mechanisms, relevant standards
2. **Experience:** Practical familiarity with fixed ladders and their inspection
3. **Training:** Instruction on inspection methods, defect recognition, severity assessment
4. **Ability:** Can systematically inspect, identify defects, assess safety implications, make decisions on continued use
5. **Assignment:** Formally given responsibility for inspections

**Important:** HSE does **NOT** require specific qualifications or certifications. Competence is based on **knowledge + experience + training + ability**.

**Can Internal Employees Be Competent Persons?**

**YES** - provided they meet the competence criteria above.

**Typical Competent Persons:**
- Experienced facilities/maintenance manager with ladder inspection training
- Engineering technician with structural knowledge and ladder inspection experience
- External ladder inspection specialist (professional service provider)
- Structural engineer (for complex or large installations)

**Not Competent:**
- Ladder users without inspection training
- Managers without technical knowledge of ladder construction
- Persons without sufficient experience to recognize defects

**Recommendation:** For most small-medium businesses, engaging an external ladder inspection specialist is cost-effective and ensures professional competence. For larger organizations with multiple ladders, training internal facilities staff may be appropriate.

## 8. KEY DIFFERENCES: OCCASIONAL WORK ACCESS vs. EMERGENCY ESCAPE

| Aspect | Occasional Work Access (Your Situation) | Emergency Escape Only (Never Used for Work) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Legislation** | Work at Height Regulations 2005 + PUWER 1998 | Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 + PUWER 1998 |
| **Risk Assessment** | **MANDATORY** under WAHR Reg 6 | Required as part of fire risk assessment |
| **Justification for Ladder Use** | **MUST justify** over safer alternatives (WAHR Schedule 6 Para 1) | Not required - emergency escape context |
| **Pre-Use Checks** | **MANDATORY** - before each use by users | Not applicable (ladder not used in normal operations) |
| **User Training** | **MANDATORY** - all users must be trained (PUWER Reg 9) | Not required (occupants use in emergency without training) |
| **Detailed Inspections** | **6-12 months** (based on use and environment) | 12 months (less frequent as no wear from use) |
| **Safety Cages/Hoops (>2.4m)** | **LEGALLY REQUIRED** OR fall arrest system | Recommended but not legally mandated |
| **Supervision** | Required until users competent (PUWER Reg 9) | Not applicable |
| **Three Points of Contact** | **MUST be maintained** during work use | Does not apply during emergency escape |
| **Signage** | General safety signage (optional) | Mandatory emergency exit signage |
| **Emergency Lighting** | Not required | Mandatory if natural light inadequate |
| **Keeping Clear** | Good practice | Legal requirement under Fire Safety Order |

**Critical Takeaway:** Work access ladders (even occasional use) have MORE STRINGENT requirements than emergency-only ladders, particularly regarding risk assessment, user training, and inspection frequency.

## 10. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

### HSE Enforcement Powers

HSE inspectors have powers under HSWA 1974 to:
- Enter premises and inspect work equipment
- Request inspection records, risk assessments, training records
- Interview employees about ladder use and training
- Issue enforcement notices if non-compliance identified

### Potential Enforcement Actions

**Improvement Notice (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/21" target="_blank">HSWA 1974 Section 21</a>):**
- Issued if inspector believes breach of health and safety law under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents" target="_blank">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>
- Requires specific actions within specified timeframe (typically 21-28 days)
- Examples: Implement inspection regime, provide user training, install safety cage, conduct risk assessment

**Prohibition Notice (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/22" target="_blank">HSWA 1974 Section 22</a>):**
- Issued if inspector believes activity involves risk of serious personal injury
- Prohibits use of ladder until requirements met
- Can be immediate or deferred
- Example: Ladder with structural damage, no safety cage on ladder over 2.4m used for work

**Prosecution:**
- Failure to comply with WAHR, PUWER, or HSWA is criminal offense
- Magistrates' Court: Fines up to £20,000 per offense
- Crown Court: Unlimited fines, imprisonment up to 2 years
- Directors/managers can be personally prosecuted for serious breaches

**Fee for Intervention (FFI):**
- HSE may charge costs of investigation if "material breach" identified
- Charged at £181 per hour (2024/25 rate)
- Costs can be substantial for extended investigations

**Common Triggers for Enforcement:**
- Serious injury/fatality involving ladder
- Complaints from employees about unsafe ladder use
- Routine HSE inspection finding no risk assessment or inspection records
- Repeat non-compliance after previous warnings

**Best Practice:** Maintain comprehensive documented compliance (risk assessment, inspection records, training records) to demonstrate ongoing compliance to HSE.

## 11. WHEN TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

### Indicators That Fixed Ladder May Not Be Appropriate

Consider installing safer alternative access if:

**Work Characteristics Change:**
- Work duration increases (>30 minutes per visit)
- Work frequency increases significantly (>10 times/day)
- Work complexity increases (requires carrying heavy tools/materials)
- Work requires two hands (not possible while maintaining three points of contact)

**User Characteristics:**
- Users include elderly, less mobile, or inexperienced persons
- High turnover of users (training burden increases)
- Users report discomfort or difficulty using ladder

**Safety Concerns:**
- Repeated near-misses or incidents
- Pre-2006 ladder lacks safety cage and retrofitting is impractical
- Structural condition deteriorating and repairs becoming frequent/costly
- Risk assessment identifies risks not adequately controlled

**Regulatory Pressure:**
- HSE raises concerns during inspection
- Difficulty justifying ladder use under WAHR Schedule 6 Para 1
- Changes to regulations or guidance

### Safer Alternatives to Consider

**Fixed Staircase:**
- Most significant improvement in safety
- Eliminates fall risk during access
- Allows carrying equipment/materials safely
- Suitable for frequent access
- **Justification needed why not adopted:** Usually cost and space constraints

**External Fire Escape Staircase:**
- Safer than ladder
- Can serve dual purpose (work access + emergency escape)
- Requires structural assessment and building regulations approval

**Mobile Elevated Work Platform (MEWP):**
- Safer for extended work at height
- Not practical for frequent brief access (setup time)
- Requires operator training and certification

**Scaffolding with Full Guardrails:**
- Safe working platform
- Not practical for permanent access
- Suitable for extended maintenance campaigns

**Remote Monitoring/Extended Tools:**
- Eliminate need for access at height
- Consider remote sensors, cameras, extended tools for ground-level operation

**Decision Criteria:**

Balance:
- **Risk reduction** (how much safer is alternative?)
- **Cost** (capital, installation, ongoing maintenance)
- **Practicability** (space, structural feasibility, building constraints)
- **SFAIRP** (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable) - is cost of alternative grossly disproportionate to marginal safety benefit?

**Document Decision:** Whether retaining ladder or installing alternative, document rationale in risk assessment.
