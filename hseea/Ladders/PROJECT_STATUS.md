# Ladders Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-04 19:30

## Current State
The Ladders project now contains comprehensive, legally accurate compliance documentation for fixed ladders in UK regulatory context. Documentation covers emergency escape ladders, work access ladders (occasional use), comparative analysis, inspection requirements, and competent person qualifications. All documents feature verified hyperlinks to specific legislation sections.

## Active Work Areas
- **Work access ladder guidance**: NEW comprehensive guide for occasional use scenarios (Fixed_Ladder_Use_At_Work.md)
- **Comparative analysis**: NEW side-by-side comparison of requirements (Fixed_vs_Emergency_Ladder_Comparison.md)
- **Link verification standards**: Implemented strict URL verification workflow in CLAUDE.md
- **Legal accuracy review**: Critical corrections to WAHR Schedule 6 interpretation completed

## Recently Completed (Current Session)
- Created Fixed_Ladder_Use_At_Work.md - 805 lines covering occasional work access (2.5-6m, up to 5x/day)
- Created Fixed_vs_Emergency_Ladder_Comparison.md - 650 lines with decision trees, cost comparisons, classification guidance
- Corrected critical error: Rest platforms at 9m+ (not 2.4m) per WAHR Schedule 6 Para 4
- Clarified safety cage requirements: BS 4211 + general duties, NOT explicit WAHR Schedule 6 requirement
- Converted all hyperlinks to HTML format with target="_blank" across all documents
- Implemented link verification process (WebFetch before inclusion)
- Fixed broken INDG455 link → replaced with verified LA455 (2021) link
- Added direct hyperlinks to specific regulation sections (WAHR Reg 4, 6; PUWER Reg 4, 5, 6, 9; HSWA s.2, 21, 22)

## Key Documentation Files
- `Emergency_Escape_Ladder.md` - Comprehensive guide for emergency escape ladders (never used for work) - 1005 lines
- `Fixed_Ladder_Use_At_Work.md` - **NEW** - Complete guide for occasional work access ladders - 805 lines
- `Fixed_vs_Emergency_Ladder_Comparison.md` - **NEW** - Side-by-side comparison with classification guidance - 650 lines
- `General_Ladders_Compliance.md` - Full compliance guide for regular work access ladders (if exists)
- `Competent_Person_Fixed_Ladder_Inspections.md` - Competence requirements for inspectors
- `Ladder_Types.md` - Overview of different ladder types and regulatory framework
- PDF versions available for markdown documents

## Next Priorities
1. Generate PDFs for new documents: Fixed_Ladder_Use_At_Work.pdf and Fixed_vs_Emergency_Ladder_Comparison.pdf
2. Verify all hyperlinks in Emergency_Escape_Ladder.md are HTML format with target="_blank"
3. Consider creating Quick Reference Card for emergency vs work classification
4. Review General_Ladders_Compliance.md for consistency with new documents
5. Consider adding worked examples/case studies for common scenarios

## Key Compliance Framework
- **Primary legislation**: Work at Height Regulations 2005, PUWER 1998, Fire Safety Order 2005
- **Design standards**: BS 4211:2005+A1:2008, BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016
- **Inspection guidance**: BS 8210:2020 (5-yearly structural surveys)
- **Height thresholds**: 2.5m (cages/hoops), 9m (rest platforms)

## Important Principles Established
- Pre-2006 ladders grandfathered under original installation standards
- Ongoing safety obligations apply regardless of installation date
- Substantial modifications trigger current standards compliance
- Minor maintenance does not trigger retrofit requirements
