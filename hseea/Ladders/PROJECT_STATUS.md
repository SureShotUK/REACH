# Ladders Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-04

## Current State
The Ladders project contains comprehensive compliance documentation for fixed ladders in UK regulatory context. Documentation covers emergency escape ladders, general work access ladders, inspection requirements, and competent person qualifications.

## Active Work Areas
- **Emergency escape ladder guidance**: Recently updated with retrospective standards application clarification
- **Design standards compliance**: Clear guidance now available on when BS 4211:2005+A1:2008 applies to existing vs new installations

## Recently Completed
- Added comprehensive "Retrospective Application of Design Standards" section to Emergency_Escape_Ladder.md
- Updated compliance checklist to distinguish between pre-2006 and post-2005 ladder requirements
- Clarified grandfathering principle for existing installations
- Documented substantial modification vs minor maintenance distinctions

## Key Documentation Files
- `Emergency_Escape_Ladder.md` - Comprehensive guide for emergency escape ladders (never used for work)
- `General_Ladders_Compliance.md` - Full compliance guide for work access ladders
- `Competent_Person_Fixed_Ladder_Inspections.md` - Competence requirements for inspectors
- `Ladder_Types.md` - Overview of different ladder types and regulatory framework
- PDF versions available for all markdown documents

## Next Priorities
1. Regenerate Emergency_Escape_Ladder.pdf from updated markdown source
2. Review if similar clarification needed in General_Ladders_Compliance.md
3. Consider adding case studies or worked examples for common scenarios

## Key Compliance Framework
- **Primary legislation**: Work at Height Regulations 2005, PUWER 1998, Fire Safety Order 2005
- **Design standards**: BS 4211:2005+A1:2008, BS EN ISO 14122-4:2016
- **Inspection guidance**: BS 8210:2020 (5-yearly structural surveys)
- **Height thresholds**: 2.5m (cages/hoops), 9m (rest platforms)

## Important Principles Established
- Pre-2006 ladders grandfathered under original installation standards
- Ongoing safety obligations apply regardless of installation date
- Substantial modifications trigger current standards compliance
- Minor maintenance does not trigger retrofit requirements
