# Fire Door Compliance: BS 476-22, Cold Smoke Seals, and BS 8214

**Building type:** Office, 2 storeys
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Under review following fire risk assessment findings

---

## Background

A fire risk assessment carried out by a professional assessor raised the following findings regarding the building's fire doors:

1. The doors do not comply with BS 476-22 because they lack a cold smoke seal around the door edge
2. All doors need to comply with BS 8214

The doors currently have an intumescent strip fitted in the centre of the door frame around the entire perimeter (except the floor), but no separate cold smoke seal.

This document evaluates the accuracy of those findings and identifies the correct compliance position.

## Finding 1: "Doors do not comply with BS 476-22 due to lack of cold smoke seal"

**The assessor's stated reason is technically incorrect.**

**BS 476-22:1987** is purely a fire resistance test standard for non-loadbearing elements of construction. It measures two criteria only:

- **Integrity (E)** - whether the door prevents passage of flames and hot gases through gaps when subjected to furnace temperatures
- **Insulation (I)** - whether temperature rise on the non-fire side is limited to 140°C mean / 180°C maximum

BS 476-22 does **not** test for, or require, cold smoke seals. A door certified to BS 476-22 with only an intumescent strip carries a valid **FD30** (or FD60) classification and is fully compliant with that standard.

Cold smoke testing is governed by a **separate standard**: **BS 476-31.1** ("Methods for Measuring Smoke Penetration Through Doorsets and Shutter Assemblies - Section 31.1: Method of Measurement Under Ambient Temperature Conditions"). This tests smoke leakage at ambient temperature at 25Pa pressure differential, with a pass criterion of no more than 3 m³/h per linear metre of joint.

Only when a door successfully passes **both** BS 476-22 (fire resistance) **and** BS 476-31.1 (cold smoke) does it receive the **FD30S** or **FD60S** designation. The "S" suffix is a separate classification, not part of BS 476-22 compliance.

The assessor appears to be conflating two separate issues:
- Compliance with BS 476-22 (fire resistance test) — **the doors pass this**
- Whether these specific locations require an FD30**S** rating (fire + smoke control) — **this is the real question**

## Intumescent Strips vs Cold Smoke Seals

These are fundamentally different products performing different functions at different stages of a fire:

| | Intumescent Strip | Cold Smoke Seal |
|---|---|---|
| **Activation** | Heat-activated, typically at 180-200°C | Passive, works at ambient (room) temperature |
| **Function** | Expands to seal door gaps against flames and hot gases | Brush pile or flexible rubber blade restricts smoke at ambient temperature |
| **Protection stage** | Active phase of fire (significant heat development) | Early stage of fire before heat develops |
| **Test standard** | BS 476-22 / BS EN 1634-1 | BS 476-31.1 / BS EN 1634-3 |
| **Classification achieved** | FD30, FD60 | FD30**S**, FD60**S** |

**An intumescent-only strip provides no cold smoke resistance.** Before the intumescent material activates, cold smoke passes freely through the gap between door leaf and frame. In most office fires, smoke causes incapacitation and death before fire-level heat develops. A door on an escape route that does not control cold smoke represents a significant risk.

Combined products exist (intumescent core with integral brush pile) that are tested to both standards and can achieve FD30S classification within a single strip.

## Are Cold Smoke Seals Required for This Building?

This depends on **where the doors are located**. Under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b" target="_blank">Approved Document B (ADB) 2019</a> (incorporating 2024 amendments), Table B1 specifies minimum fire door ratings by location:

| Location | Minimum Required Rating |
|---|---|
| **Doors to protected stairways (escape stairs)** | **FD30S** — smoke control required |
| **Doors subdividing escape corridors** | **FD30S** — smoke control required |
| Compartment walls separating buildings | FD60 |
| Other internal fire doors | FD30 — no smoke seal required |

For a **2-storey office building**, the critical locations are staircase enclosure doors and doors on protected corridors forming the means of escape. These locations almost certainly require **FD30S** under ADB.

If the fire doors in question are located on escape routes protecting stairways or corridors, the assessor's **underlying concern is likely correct** — the absence of cold smoke seals means those doors do not achieve the FD30S classification required at those locations. The stated basis (non-compliance with BS 476-22) is wrong; the conclusion (the doors are inadequate for escape route use) may be right.

Doors in locations that only require FD30 (internal compartmentation not on an escape route) do **not** require cold smoke seals.

## Finding 2: "All doors need to comply with BS 8214"

**This overstates the legal status of BS 8214.**

<a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/bs-8214/" target="_blank">BS 8214:2016</a> ("Timber-based fire door assemblies — Code of practice") is a **code of practice**, not statute. There is no legal provision that mandates compliance with BS 8214 directly.

The legal obligations come from:

- <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" target="_blank">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (SI 2005/1541)</a> — Articles 8–22 require the responsible person to carry out a suitable fire risk assessment and implement adequate fire safety measures. Article 17 requires fire safety equipment, including fire doors, to be maintained in efficient working order.
- **Building Regulations 2010, Part B** (implemented via Approved Document B) — sets the technical requirements for fire door ratings by location.

BS 8214 is the recognised best practice route to demonstrating compliance with those legal requirements. Following it is strongly advisable and provides evidence of compliance, but the legal duties flow from the RRO and Building Regulations — not from BS 8214 itself.

## Is BS 476-22 Still a Valid Standard?

**Yes — currently.** Following the March 2024 amendment to ADB (Table C1, Appendix C), doors tested to BS 476-22 remain valid and compliant with building regulations. The Association of Specialist Door Manufacturers (ASDMA) has confirmed: *"test results to BS 476 Part 22 continue to be compliant with building regulations, along with EN 1634-1."*

BS 476-22 will be **removed from ADB in September 2029** for new fire door installations, after which BS EN 1634-1 will be the required test standard. Existing installed doors tested to BS 476-22 do not need replacement simply because the standard is being phased out — provided they are correctly installed, maintained, and remain fit for purpose.

## Summary of Compliance Position

| Issue | Assessor's Claim | Correct Position |
|---|---|---|
| Doors don't comply with BS 476-22 | Stated reason (no smoke seal) | **Incorrect** — BS 476-22 does not require smoke seals |
| Cold smoke seals are needed | Implied requirement | **Likely correct** for escape route doors requiring FD30S under ADB Table B1 |
| All doors must comply with BS 8214 | Stated as legal requirement | **Overstated** — BS 8214 is a code of practice, not statute |
| BS 476-22 is no longer valid | Implied by assessor | **Incorrect** — valid until September 2029 |

## Recommended Actions

1. **Challenge the wording** of the fire risk assessment report — the stated reason for non-compliance with BS 476-22 is technically incorrect and should be corrected to accurately reflect the actual compliance gap.

2. **Identify which doors are on protected escape routes** — staircase enclosure doors and protected corridor doors in a 2-storey office are the priority locations where FD30S is required.

3. **For escape route doors lacking FD30S certification:**
   - Option A: Retrofit a combined intumescent/smoke seal strip — but **only if the specific door assembly has been tested and certified with that seal type**. Fitting a seal to an untested assembly does not automatically achieve FD30S classification.
   - Option B: Replace door sets with certified FD30S assemblies.
   - Option C: Engage a fire door specialist to assess whether existing frames and door sets can be certified with appropriate seals.

4. **Do not add smoke seals indiscriminately** to all doors — only escape route doors requiring FD30S need them. Internal compartmentation doors on non-escape routes may only require FD30.

5. **Implement a fire door inspection regime** under Article 17 of the RRO — maintain written records of regular inspection and maintenance.
