# Nebosh Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-17

## Current State

New NEBOSH National General Certificate (NGC) study project successfully established with comprehensive infrastructure and initial study materials. Project includes specialized research agent, structured documentation, and two major study documents covering foundational NGC concepts (moral reasons for H&S management and human factors/behavior).

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Support preparation for NEBOSH National General Certificate qualification through organized study materials, notes, practice resources, and research tools.

**Qualification Structure**:
- **NG1**: Management of Health and Safety (5 elements, written assessment)
- **NG2**: Risk Assessment (practical workplace assessment)

## Active Work Areas

### ✅ Completed

**Infrastructure**:
- Project folder structure (study-notes, assessments, reference)
- Project-specific CLAUDE.md with NGC guidance
- Specialized `gemini-nebosh-researcher` agent
- README with study approach and syllabus overview
- Session tracking and documentation files

**Study Materials**:
- **LearningOutcomes.md** - Consolidated learning outcomes table from all Elements 1-9
- **CadburyHistory.md** (35KB) - Historical case study of Cadbury's Bournville and Joseph Rowntree's welfare programs demonstrating moral foundations of workplace H&S (Element 1)
- **Maslow.md** (45KB) - Maslow's hierarchy of needs applied to workplace behavior and impact of poor H&S standards (Element 3)

### 🔄 In Progress

Currently: Initial foundational materials complete. Ready to expand into remaining syllabus areas.
