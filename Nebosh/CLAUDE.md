# CLAUDE.md (Nebosh Project)

This file provides Nebosh-specific guidance to Claude Code when working in this project.

> **Note**: This supplements the shared CLAUDE.md at `/terminai/CLAUDE.md`. Read both files for complete guidance.

## Repository Purpose

This is a study and reference repository for the **NEBOSH National General Certificate in Occupational Health and Safety (NGC)**. The repository contains study notes, learning materials, assessment practice, and reference resources to support preparation for the NEBOSH NGC qualification.

## About NEBOSH NGC

The NEBOSH National General Certificate is the UK's leading health and safety qualification for supervisors, managers, and those with health and safety responsibilities. It provides a broad understanding of health and safety issues and is recognized by employers worldwide.

**Qualification Structure:**
- **NG1**: Management of Health and Safety (written assessment)
- **NG2**: Risk Assessment (practical assessment)

## Primary Objectives

When working in this repository, help the user to:

1. **Master Core Concepts**: Understand fundamental health and safety principles and regulations
2. **Prepare for Assessments**: Practice exam-style questions and risk assessment scenarios
3. **Organize Study Materials**: Structure notes, key points, and learning resources effectively
4. **Apply Knowledge**: Link theoretical concepts to practical workplace scenarios
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor learning progress and identify areas needing more focus

## Document Organization

- `/study-notes/` - Organized study notes by NGC syllabus elements
- `/assessments/` - Practice questions, mock exams, and risk assessment examples
- `/reference/` - Quick reference materials, key definitions, acronym lists
- `/regulations/` - UK health and safety legislation relevant to NGC
- `/case-studies/` - Real-world scenarios and examples for learning

## Key Study Areas (NGC Syllabus)

### NG1: Management of Health and Safety

**Element 1: Why We Should Manage Workplace Health and Safety**
- Moral, legal, and financial reasons for health and safety
- Role of national and international organizations
- Sources of information and guidance

**Element 2: How Health and Safety Management Systems Work and What They Look Like**
- HSG65 Plan-Do-Check-Act model
- Policy, organizing, planning, implementation, measuring, auditing, and review
- Monitoring and incident investigation

**Element 3: Managing Risk - Understanding People and Processes**
- Human factors and behavior
- Organizational culture and leadership
- Competence and training
- Communication and consultation

**Element 4: Health and Safety Management Systems - Risk Assessment**
- General risk assessment process
- Hazard identification and risk evaluation
- Risk control hierarchy
- Specific risk assessments (fire, manual handling, etc.)

**Element 5: Health and Safety Management Systems - Monitoring, Review and Audit**
- Active and reactive monitoring
- Incident investigation techniques
- Audit and inspection procedures
- Management review processes

### NG2: Risk Assessment (Practical)

- Conducting workplace risk assessments
- Identifying hazards in real work environments
- Evaluating existing controls
- Recommending improvements
- Documenting findings professionally

## Learning Approach

**Study Principles:**
- Connect concepts to real workplace examples
- Use the hierarchy of controls (Elimination → Substitution → Engineering → Administrative → PPE)
- Apply HSG65 Plan-Do-Check-Act thinking to all scenarios
- Practice exam technique and timing
- Relate learning to UK health and safety law

**Question Practice:**
- NGC questions use command words: "Identify," "Outline," "Describe," "Explain," "Give"
- Each command word requires specific depth and detail
- Practice structuring answers with clear, separate points
- Use workplace examples to illustrate understanding

**Risk Assessment Practice:**
- Practice identifying hazards systematically (environment, equipment, people, processes)
- Evaluate both likelihood and severity
- Consider existing controls before recommending new ones
- Prioritize recommendations based on risk level
- Present findings clearly and professionally

## UK Health and Safety Context

**Key Legislation Relevant to NGC:**
- Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
- Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
- COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations 2002
- Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992
- Work at Height Regulations 2005
- Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992
- Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER)
- Electricity at Work Regulations 1989
- RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences) Regulations 2013
- Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005

**Key Guidance Documents:**
- HSG65: Managing for Health and Safety
- HSG48: Reducing Error and Influencing Behaviour
- INDG163: Five Steps to Risk Assessment
- Various topic-specific HSE guidance series

## Typical Workflows

**Study Session**: User requests topic overview → Provide structured summary of key concepts → Relate to syllabus elements → Offer examples and practice questions → Suggest related topics to study next

**Question Practice**: User attempts practice question → Review answer against marking criteria → Provide constructive feedback → Explain where points could be gained → Offer similar questions for more practice

**Concept Clarification**: User asks about specific concept → Explain clearly with examples → Link to relevant regulations and guidance → Connect to other NGC topics → Provide workplace scenarios demonstrating the concept

**Risk Assessment Practice**: User describes scenario → Guide through systematic hazard identification → Help evaluate risks and controls → Suggest improvements using hierarchy of controls → Advise on professional documentation

**Exam Preparation**: User preparing for assessment → Review syllabus coverage → Identify knowledge gaps → Practice exam technique → Time management strategies → Build confidence with mock scenarios

## Research and Reference Sources

When conducting research for NGC study:
- HSE website (hse.gov.uk) - official source for UK health and safety guidance
- NEBOSH official materials and syllabus
- legislation.gov.uk - full text of UK health and safety regulations
- HSE guidance series (HSG, INDG, L-series)
- IOSH and other professional body resources

**Important**: NGC is specifically focused on UK health and safety law and practice. Avoid referencing non-UK jurisdictions unless explicitly comparing international approaches.

## Project-Specific Agents

This project has specialized agents available:
- `gemini-nebosh-researcher` - Web research for NEBOSH NGC study materials, regulations, and guidance

## Study Tips

- Break study into manageable chunks aligned with syllabus elements
- Use active recall and spaced repetition
- Practice writing timed answers to build exam speed
- Create summary sheets for quick revision
- Relate everything back to HSG65 and the risk assessment process
- Use real workplace examples to cement understanding
- Form study groups or discussion partners if possible
- Review examiner reports to understand common mistakes
- Practice, practice, practice risk assessments

## Success Criteria

You'll be ready for NGC when you can:
- Explain the moral, legal, and financial reasons for health and safety management
- Describe how HSG65 management system works
- Identify human factors that influence behavior
- Conduct systematic risk assessments
- Apply the hierarchy of controls to any scenario
- Structure answers using appropriate command word techniques
- Write professional risk assessment documentation
- Recall key regulations and their basic requirements
- Apply health and safety principles to workplace scenarios

Good luck with your NEBOSH NGC studies!
