## Assessment Types

- **OBE**: Open Book Examination (NG1 written assessment)
- **Practical**: NG2 Risk Assessment (practical workplace assessment)

## Key Notes

### Elements 1-4: Management and System Elements
These elements focus on the theoretical understanding of health and safety management, legal requirements, culture, and monitoring systems.

### Elements 5-11: Workplace Risk Assessment
Elements 5-11 all contribute to the practical risk assessment component (NG2), where learners must demonstrate their ability to:
- Profile and prioritise workplace risks
- Inspect the workplace systematically
- Recognise a wide range of common hazards across different categories
- Evaluate risks taking account of existing controls
- Recommend further control measures following the hierarchy of controls
- Plan actions to implement improvements

The consolidated learning outcome for Elements 5-11 emphasizes that the practical assessment must consider hazards from ALL these elements and meet best practice standards for being "suitable and sufficient" as required by UK health and safety law.
