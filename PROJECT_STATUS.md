# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-06 09:00

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/SureShotUK/REACH.git

## Current State
The terminai repository contains three specialized project folders for domain-specific knowledge management: HSEEA (health/safety/environment), IT (infrastructure/security), and REACH (chemical compliance). REACH project refined with >1000 t/year tonnage band cost updates and SME status advantages. Two new comprehensive documents created: FARM REACH LoA explanation (£40k budget recommendation) and Only Representative clarification (EU vs non-EU supplier treatment identical under UK REACH).
