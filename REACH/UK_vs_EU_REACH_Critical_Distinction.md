# CRITICAL DISTINCTION: UK REACH vs EU REACH Registration

**Date:** November 5, 2025
**This document answers:** "Who does the registration need to be with?"

---

## THE CRITICAL MISUNDERSTANDING

### You Said:
> "I assumed that the registration of the substance was already done if it appears in the REACH register, and Urea does appear in the register."

### The Problem:
**There are now TWO separate REACH registers:**
1. **EU REACH** - Managed by ECHA (European Chemicals Agency)
2. **UK REACH** - Managed by HSE (Health and Safety Executive, UK)

**Post-Brexit, these are COMPLETELY SEPARATE systems.**

---

## Article 5: "Registered in Accordance with Title II"

### The Full Legal Wording

**Article 5 of The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1577):**

> "A person must not manufacture a substance in Great Britain or place a substance on the market in Great Britain unless that substance has been **registered in accordance with Title II** of this Regulation."

### What "Title II of This Regulation" Means

**"Title II of This Regulation"** = **Title II of UK REACH**

**Title II specifies registration must be submitted to:**
- **The Agency** = UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
- **NOT** the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)

**Article 16(1) - Where to Submit Registration:**
> "The registration must be submitted to **the Agency** [HSE]."

---

## Which REACH Register Did You Check?

### EU REACH Register (ECHA Database)
**Website:** echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances

If you checked here and found Urea:
- ✓ **YES** - Urea IS registered in EU REACH
- ✓ **YES** - Multiple companies have EU REACH registrations for Urea
- ❌ **BUT** - This does NOT satisfy Article 5 of UK REACH
- ❌ **Importing to GB based on EU REACH registration is ILLEGAL**

### UK REACH Register (HSE Database)
**Website:** www.hse.gov.uk/reach/ (search functionality)

**This is what matters for GB imports.**

If Urea appears here with YOUR company as registrant (or your supplier's Only Representative):
- ✓ You can legally import to GB

If Urea does NOT appear here, or appears but registered by a different company with no relationship to you:
- ❌ You CANNOT legally import to GB

---

## Post-Brexit Split: Why EU REACH Registration Doesn't Work

### Before Brexit (Before January 1, 2021)
- One REACH system (EU REACH)
- One register (ECHA)
- Registration covered entire EU including UK
- Urea registered in ECHA = could import to UK

### After Brexit (January 1, 2021 onwards)
- Two separate REACH systems:
  - **EU REACH** (for EU27)
  - **UK REACH** (for Great Britain)
- Two separate registers:
  - **ECHA database** (for EU imports)
  - **HSE database** (for GB imports)
- Registration in ECHA = can import to EU27
- **Registration in HSE = can import to GB**
- **They do NOT cross-recognize each other**

**The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020** created UK REACH as a separate regime.

---

## Transition Arrangements: Grandfathering

### The Grandfathering Process

To avoid disruption, UK REACH included a "grandfathering" process:

**Companies that held EU REACH registrations as GB-based legal entities on 31 Dec 2020:**
- Could submit basic information to HSE by April 30, 2021
- This "grandfathered" their EU REACH registration into UK REACH
- Given extended deadlines to submit full UK REACH data (Oct 2026/2028/2030)

**If you did NOT hold an EU REACH registration as a GB entity before Brexit:**
- You do NOT benefit from grandfathering
- You need a new UK REACH registration from scratch

### Did You Submit Grandfathering Information?

From your earlier responses:
- **Grandfathering:** ❌ No
- **DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification):** ❌ No

This means:
- You are NOT operating under a grandfathered registration
- Seeing Urea in ECHA database does NOT help you
- You need a UK REACH registration with HSE

---

## How to Check UK REACH Registration Status

### Official HSE UK REACH Database

**Currently, HSE does NOT have a public searchable database like ECHA.**

To verify if a substance has UK REACH registration:

1. **Contact HSE directly:**
   - Email: ukreach@hse.gov.uk
   - Phone: +44 (0)203 028 3343
   - Ask: "Can you confirm if Urea (CAS 57-13-6) has any UK REACH registrations?"

2. **Ask your supplier:**
   - Request their UK REACH registration number
   - Request HSE confirmation document

3. **Engage a REACH consultant:**
   - They have access to UK REACH registration information
   - Can verify if registrations exist for Urea

### What You'll Find

**For Urea (CAS 57-13-6):**

**EU REACH (ECHA):**
- ✓ Multiple registrations exist
- ✓ Heavily registered substance (fertilizer, industrial use)
- ✓ Can see registration dossiers on ECHA website

**UK REACH (HSE):**
- ❓ Unknown without checking with HSE
- ❓ Some companies may have grandfathered registrations
- ❓ Some companies may have submitted new UK registrations
- **❌ But YOUR company does NOT have access to these registrations**

---

## Why Seeing Urea in "The Register" Doesn't Help You

### The Registration is Tied to a Legal Entity

Even if Company X has registered Urea with UK HSE:
- Company X can import Urea to GB
- Company X can manufacture Urea in GB
- Company X can sell Urea in GB

**But:**
- Company Y (you) CANNOT import Urea using Company X's registration
- Each importer needs their own registration or arrangement

### The Legal Structure

**Article 5 states:** "A **person** must not place a substance on the market unless **that substance** has been registered."

**"That substance"** means: The specific batch/shipment that YOU are importing.

**For your import to be legal:**
- YOU must be the registrant, OR
- Your supplier must have a GB-based Only Representative who is the registrant, OR
- You must purchase from a GB-based company who is the registrant

**Seeing Urea registered by a random third party does NOT satisfy Article 5 for YOUR imports.**

## Analogy: Driving License vs. Vehicle Registration

### Common Misunderstanding (Like Vehicle Registration)
You might think REACH works like vehicle registration:
- A car is registered with the DVLA
- Anyone with a valid license can drive that car
- The registration follows the car, not the driver

### How REACH Actually Works (Like Driving License)
REACH works like a driving license, not vehicle registration:
- Each person needs their own license to drive
- Just because your neighbor has a license doesn't mean YOU can drive
- The license is tied to the person, not the vehicle

Similarly:
- Each legal entity (company) needs their own registration (or OR arrangement) to import
- Just because Company X has registered Urea doesn't mean YOU can import
- The registration is tied to the registrant, not the substance

---

## The Two Registrations You Might Have Seen

### 1. EU REACH Registration (ECHA)

**Where:** https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances

**Search for:** Urea, CAS 57-13-6

**What you'll find:**
- Multiple EU REACH registrations
- Registration numbers starting with "01-"
- Tonnage bands (1-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000+)
- Multiple registrants listed

**What this means:**
- ✓ Urea is registered for import into EU27 countries
- ❌ This does NOT allow import into Great Britain
- ❌ Article 5 of UK REACH is NOT satisfied by EU REACH registration

### 2. UK REACH Registration (HSE)

**Where:** Not publicly searchable; must contact HSE

**What you need:**
- UK REACH registration number (different format from EU)
- Registered with UK HSE, not with ECHA
- YOUR company listed as registrant (or supplier's OR)

**What this means:**
- ✓ Satisfies Article 5 of UK REACH
- ✓ You can legally import into Great Britain
- ✓ Your specific imports are covered

---

## Your Specific Situation

### What You Probably Did
1. Heard "you need REACH registration to import Urea"
2. Checked ECHA database (EU REACH)
3. Saw Urea is registered in ECHA
4. Assumed: "Urea is registered, so I can import it"
5. Began importing to GB

### Why This Doesn't Work

**Article 5 of UK REACH requires:**
- Registration **with UK HSE** (not ECHA)
- Registration **in your name** or via Only Representative (not random third party)
- For **GB imports** (EU REACH doesn't cover GB anymore)

**EU REACH registration in ECHA:**
- ✓ Allows import to EU27 countries
- ❌ Does NOT allow import to Great Britain
- ❌ Does NOT satisfy UK REACH Article 5

### What You Need to Do

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Switch to GB supplier
- Find GB-based Urea supplier with UK REACH registration
- Verify their UK HSE registration number
- Become downstream user (no registration needed)

**Option 2:** Check if your current supplier has UK REACH via Only Representative
- Ask: "Do you have a GB-based Only Representative with UK REACH registration?"
- If YES: Get the OR's details and UK REACH registration number
- If NO: You cannot continue importing from this supplier

**Option 3:** Obtain your own UK REACH registration
- Submit registration to UK HSE (not ECHA)
- Cost: £65k-£345k
- Timeline: 12-24 months
- Cannot import during registration process

## Key Legislation References

### UK REACH is a Separate Legal Framework

**The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1577):**
- Created UK REACH as standalone UK law
- Copied structure of EU REACH but modified for UK
- References to "the Agency" changed from ECHA to HSE
- Registration submissions go to HSE, not ECHA

**Regulation 2 - Interpretation:**
> "**the Agency** means the Health and Safety Executive"

**Article 16(1) - Registration Submissions:**
> "The registration must be submitted to **the Agency** [HSE]."

**This is UK law, separate from EU law.**

### EU REACH Still Exists (For EU27)

**Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (EU REACH):**
- Still operates in EU27 countries
- Managed by ECHA
- Registrations submitted to ECHA
- Does NOT cover Great Britain anymore

**Both exist, but they are SEPARATE.**

---

## Summary: Answer to Your Question

### "Who does the registration need to be with?"

**Answer:** The **UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE)**, NOT the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).

### "Urea appears in the REACH register"

**You checked:** EU REACH (ECHA database) ✓

**You need:** UK REACH (HSE database) ❌

**This is why you are non-compliant:**
- EU REACH registration does NOT satisfy Article 5 of UK REACH
- Article 5 requires registration "in accordance with Title II" of UK REACH
- Title II specifies registration with "the Agency" = HSE

### The Bottom Line

**Seeing Urea registered in ECHA (EU REACH):**
- ✓ Confirms Urea is a registered substance in EU
- ✓ Confirms safety data exists
- ❌ Does NOT allow you to import to GB
- ❌ Does NOT satisfy UK REACH Article 5

**You need:**
- UK REACH registration with HSE, OR
- Supplier's Only Representative with UK REACH registration, OR
- GB supplier with UK REACH registration (become downstream user)

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Stop Assuming EU REACH = UK REACH
Post-Brexit, these are separate. EU registration does not work for GB.

### 2. Contact HSE to Confirm
**Email:** ukreach@hse.gov.uk
**Ask:** "I see Urea (CAS 57-13-6) is registered in the EU REACH database (ECHA). Does this EU registration allow me to import Urea into Great Britain?"

**HSE will confirm:** NO, you need UK REACH registration with HSE.

### 3. Ask Your Current Supplier
**Question:** "Do you have a UK REACH registration or GB-based Only Representative for Urea?"

If NO: You must stop importing from this supplier immediately.

### 4. Find GB Suppliers with UK REACH Registration
- GB-based companies selling Urea in GB
- They will have UK REACH registration with HSE
- You become downstream user (no registration needed)
