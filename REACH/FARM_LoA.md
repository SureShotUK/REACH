# FARM REACH Letter of Access (LoA) - Explained

**Document Purpose:** Understanding the FARM REACH Letter of Access option for Urea UK REACH registration

**Your Situation:** SME importing >1000 tonnes/year Urea into GB

**Date Created:** November 6, 2025

---

## What is FARM REACH?

**FARM REACH** is a consortium (group of companies) that manages REACH registration data for various chemical substances used in agriculture and industry, including **Urea (CAS 57-13-6)**.

**Key Facts:**
- Consortium for agricultural and industrial chemicals
- Holds comprehensive REACH registration data packages
- Provides data access to companies needing to register substances
- Has existing EU REACH and UK REACH data for Urea (all Annexes including Annex X)
- Multiple companies have already used their services for Urea registrations

**Purpose:** To share the enormous costs of chemical safety testing among multiple companies rather than each company generating duplicate data.

---

## What is a Letter of Access (LoA)?

A **Letter of Access (LoA)** is a legal commercial agreement that grants you:

### The Right to Reference Existing Data

Instead of:
- ❌ Conducting your own animal testing (costs £150,000-£350,000)
- ❌ Generating new toxicology studies (takes 2-4 years)
- ❌ Commissioning ecotoxicology studies (costs £80,000-£200,000)

You can:
- ✓ **Reference** the consortium's existing data in your registration dossier
- ✓ Use data that's already been accepted by regulators
- ✓ Submit your registration much faster and cheaper

### Think of It Like This

**LoA = Buying a license to use someone else's data**

Similar to:
- Buying a software license (you can use it, but don't own the source code)
- Licensing a patent (you can use the invention, but don't own it)
- Buying access to a database (you can query it, but don't own the data)

**You get:** Legal permission to tell HSE "Our registration uses the data from FARM REACH's Lead Registrant dossier"

**You don't get:** The actual raw data, ownership of studies, or consortium membership benefits

## Key Questions to Ask FARM REACH

When you contact FARM REACH in Q1 2026, ask:

### 1. Data Coverage
- ✓ "Does the LoA cover ALL Annex X data requirements for >1000 t/year?"
- ✓ "Are all long-term toxicity studies included?"
- ✓ "Are chronic aquatic toxicity studies (fish, daphnia) included?"
- ✓ "Is the reproductive toxicity extended one-generation study included?"

### 2. UK REACH Specific
- ✓ "Is this data package accepted for UK REACH registrations?"
- ✓ "How many companies have used this LoA for UK REACH Urea registrations?"
- ✓ "Any known issues with HSE acceptance of this data?"

### 3. Use Coverage
- ✓ "What uses are covered in the data package?"
- ✓ "Are fertilizer applications covered?"
- ✓ "Are AdBlue/DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) applications covered?"
- ✓ "Are industrial chemical synthesis applications covered?"
- ✓ "Do we need additional data for any specific uses?"

### 4. Practical Matters
- ✓ "What documentation do we receive upon signing LoA?"
- ✓ "How does our consultant access the data references?"
- ✓ "What is the current exchange rate or can we pay in GBP?"
- ✓ "Is the price fixed or subject to change?"
- ✓ "Are there any additional fees or ongoing costs?"

### 5. Timeline
- ✓ "How long from signing LoA to receiving data access?"
- ✓ "Any delays or issues to be aware of?"
- ✓ "Can this be completed in time for October 2028 deadline?"

### 6. Support
- ✓ "What technical support is provided with LoA?"
- ✓ "Can we contact you if HSE has questions about the data?"
- ✓ "Who do we contact if issues arise during registration?"

## Risks and Considerations

### Low Risks (Manageable)

**1. Data May Not Cover All Your Uses**
- **Mitigation:** Verify uses covered during initial inquiry
- **Backup Plan:** Consultant can prepare additional use descriptions or limited CSA

**2. Exchange Rate Fluctuation (€3,322)**
- **Risk:** Euro price could increase in GBP terms
- **Impact:** Potential additional £100-£300 cost
- **Mitigation:** Lock in price when you sign agreement

**3. Consultant Dependency**
- **Risk:** You rely heavily on consultant to use LoA correctly
- **Impact:** Higher consultant fees if they're inefficient
- **Mitigation:** Select experienced consultant with LoA experience

### Very Low Risks (Unlikely)

**4. HSE Questions About Data**
- **Risk:** HSE may have questions about referenced data
- **Likelihood:** Very low (Urea is well-studied, data widely accepted)
- **Mitigation:** Consultant handles HSE correspondence; FARM REACH may assist

**5. Data Package Incomplete**
- **Risk:** Specific Annex X data gaps for your uses
- **Likelihood:** Very low for Urea (extremely well-studied)
- **Mitigation:** Identify during initial inquiry; may need targeted additional data

---

## Alternative: When Full Consortium Might Be Better

**Consider full consortium membership instead of LoA if:**

### Your Situation Includes:

❓ **Complex or unusual uses** of Urea (not standard fertilizer/AdBlue/industrial)
- Full consortium provides more technical support for custom exposure scenarios

❓ **Large company** with in-house regulatory team
- Benefits more from consortium networking and regulatory intelligence

❓ **Multiple substances** to register
- Consortium membership for multiple substances may have economies of scale

❓ **Long-term regulatory involvement** desired
- Want ongoing updates, amendments, regulatory monitoring

❓ **Limited consultant budget** but have internal technical staff
- Consortium may include more dossier support, reducing consultant costs

❓ **Consortium price is competitive**
- If quoted consortium membership is £15,000-£18,000, the gap narrows
- Full support may be worth £10,000-£12,000 more

### For Your Situation:

Given you're an **SME, importing >1000 t/year Urea** with **standard uses**:

**LoA Route is still recommended** unless consortium offers very competitive pricing (<£18,000 total).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Is €3,322 a one-time payment or ongoing?
**A:** One-time payment. No ongoing fees. You get permanent data access rights for your registration.

### Q2: Can we negotiate the LoA price?
**A:** Unlikely. Consortium prices are typically fixed based on tonnage band. However, worth asking if multiple substances are being registered.

### Q3: What if we increase import volume beyond 1000 t/year?
**A:** If you move to higher tonnage band (e.g., >10,000 t/year), you may need to update registration. Check if LoA covers higher bands or if additional payment required.

### Q4: Can we share the LoA with another company?
**A:** No. LoA is company-specific. Each legal entity needs its own LoA for their own registration.

### Q5: What if FARM REACH consortium dissolves?
**A:** Your data rights remain valid. LoA grants you permanent reference rights regardless of consortium status.

### Q6: Do we own the data after paying LoA fee?
**A:** No. You own the **right to reference** the data, not the data itself. FARM REACH retains ownership.

### Q7: Can our consultant see the actual studies?
**A:** Depends on LoA terms. Usually consultants get access to summaries and key data points sufficient for dossier preparation, not full study reports.

### Q8: What if HSE rejects our registration?
**A:** Highly unlikely with FARM REACH data for Urea. If issues arise, typically related to YOUR company-specific CSR/uses, not the consortium data.

### Q9: Is FARM REACH reputable?
**A:** Yes, established consortium for agricultural/industrial chemicals. However, verify through your consultant and check references from other companies who've used their LoA.

### Q10: When should we contact FARM REACH?
**A:** Q1 2026, AFTER DUIN is submitted and accepted. No point paying LoA fee before confirming your registration deadline.
