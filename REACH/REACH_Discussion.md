# UK REACH Compliance Discussion Document

**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive overview of UK REACH requirements, penalties, and compliance pathways for Urea imports

---

## 1. Penalties for Non-Compliance in Higher Courts

### Crown Court Penalties

Under The REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Enforcement Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/2852), breaches of Article 5 (the "no data, no market" principle) constitute criminal offenses in the United Kingdom.

**Maximum penalties on conviction on indictment (Crown Court):**

| Penalty Type | Maximum Term |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Fine** | **Unlimited** (no statutory maximum) |
| **Imprisonment** | **Up to 2 years** |
| **Combined** | Both fine AND imprisonment may be imposed together |

**Source:** The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008, Regulation 17; Health and Safety Executive (HSE) enforcement guidance at www.hse.gov.uk/reach/enforcement-offences-penalties.htm

### Comparison with Summary Convictions

For context, penalties in Magistrates Court (summary conviction) are limited to:
- Fine: Up to £5,000
- Imprisonment: Up to 3 months

**Important:** Under Regulation 20 of The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008, company directors and officers can face **personal criminal liability** for offenses committed by the company with their consent, connivance, or due to their neglect.

### Additional Consequences

Beyond direct legal penalties, Crown Court conviction can result in:
- Criminal record for the business and/or individuals
- Director disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986
- Reputational damage affecting future business operations
- Insurance policy voidance or premium increases
- Business closure in severe cases

**Important Note:** The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008 do not provide for a "due diligence" defense. Being unaware of UK REACH requirements does not constitute a legal excuse for non-compliance.

## 2. Late DUIN Submissions and Registration Deadlines

### What is a DUIN?

A DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification) is a notification mechanism created under Article 127E of UK REACH that allows eligible companies to defer their registration obligations until specific future deadlines.

### Original Deadline

**DUIN submission deadline:** October 27, 2021 (300 days after the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021)

**Source:** HSE guidance on Downstream User Import Notifications at www.hse.gov.uk/reach/duin.htm

### Late DUIN Submissions - Still Possible

The HSE has confirmed that companies eligible for DUIN can **still submit late notifications** after the October 27, 2021 deadline.

**HSE states:** "If you did not notify HSE and wish to continue to import EU REACH registered substances into Great Britain at or above one tonne per year, you can still submit a notification, if eligible to do so. You should do this as soon as possible."

**Source:** HSE DUIN guidance page (www.hse.gov.uk/reach/duin.htm), accessed November 2025

### What Was a "Downstream User" Under EU REACH?

To understand DUIN eligibility, it's essential to understand what constituted a "downstream user" under EU REACH before Brexit.

**Pre-Brexit Status (Before January 1, 2021):**

When the United Kingdom was part of the European Union, EU REACH applied across all member states. Under Article 3(13) of EU REACH, a **"downstream user"** was defined as:

> "Any natural or legal person established within the Community [EU], other than the manufacturer or the importer, who uses a substance, either on its own or in a mixture, in the course of their industrial or professional activities."

**Source:** Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (EU REACH), Article 3(13)

**Practical Application for GB Companies:**

A GB-based company was classified as a downstream user if they:

1. **Purchased substances from EU suppliers** (e.g., from France, Germany, Netherlands, or other EU member states including the UK itself)
2. **The supplier held a valid EU REACH registration** with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)
3. **Used the substance in their operations OR distributed it onwards** within the EU market

**Critically:** Movement of substances **within the EU** was NOT considered "importing" under EU REACH. Only bringing substances from **outside the EU** into the EU constituted importation.

**Downstream User Obligations Under EU REACH:**

Downstream users had **minimal regulatory obligations**:

- ✅ **NO registration requirement** - They did not need to register substances with ECHA
- ✅ **NO data generation** - They were not responsible for toxicological testing
- ✅ **NO registration fees** - Zero fees paid to ECHA
- ✅ **Limited compliance tasks** - Primarily implementing risk management measures from supplier safety data sheets and maintaining records

The EU supplier (manufacturer or importer) held the EU REACH registration, and that registration covered the entire EU supply chain, including all downstream users across all member states.

**What Brexit Changed:**

On January 1, 2021, the UK left the EU and Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) became a separate regulatory territory under UK REACH.

**The same transaction was suddenly treated differently:**

| Before Brexit | After Brexit |
|---------------|--------------|
| GB company purchases from EU supplier | GB company purchases from EU supplier |
| Movement within EU = NOT import | Movement from EU to GB = **IMPORT** |
| GB company = Downstream user | GB company = **IMPORTER** |
| No registration needed | **Registration required with HSE** |
| Covered by supplier's EU REACH registration | Supplier's EU REACH does NOT apply to GB |

**The Problem:** Overnight, thousands of GB companies transitioned from:
- **Status:** Downstream user (no registration obligations)
- **To:** Importer (full UK REACH registration required)

Many of these companies had no prior experience with REACH registration, had never generated toxicological data, and were unprepared for the substantial costs and technical requirements of registration.

**Why DUIN Was Created:**

The DUIN mechanism was specifically designed to address this situation. It acknowledged that:
- These companies were compliant under EU REACH as downstream users
- They had legitimate business relationships with EU suppliers holding valid EU REACH registrations
- They needed time to transition from downstream user status to full registrant status
- Immediate registration requirements (effective January 1, 2021) would be commercially devastating

By submitting a DUIN, these former downstream users could:
- Acknowledge their new status as importers under UK REACH
- Receive deferred registration deadlines (2026-2030 based on tonnage)
- Continue importing while preparing for full UK REACH registration
- Find consortiums, gather data, and budget for registration costs

**Source:** HSE guidance explains that DUINs were for "GB-based companies that were downstream users or distributors under EU REACH in the 2 years prior to 1 January 2021" (www.hse.gov.uk/reach/duin.htm)

### Eligibility Criteria for DUIN Submission

With this background, the eligibility criteria for submitting a DUIN (including late submissions) become clear.

To be eligible to submit a DUIN, a company must meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Historical Status:** The company must have been either:
   - A downstream user under EU REACH, OR
   - A distributor under EU REACH, OR
   - Regarded as a downstream user by virtue of an Only Representative (OR) agreement

2. **Time Period:** This status must have existed in the **2 years prior to January 1, 2021** (i.e., during 2019-2020)

3. **Source of Supply:** The company must have been importing substances from EU suppliers who held valid EU REACH registrations at that time

4. **Location:** The company must be Great Britain (GB)-based (England, Scotland, Wales - not Northern Ireland)

**Key Point:** Companies that began importing substances from outside GB **after January 1, 2021** are NOT eligible for DUIN and must pursue full registration immediately.

### Registration Deadlines with DUIN

If a DUIN is successfully submitted, registration deadlines are deferred based on tonnage band and hazard classification:

**Extended registration deadlines under The REACH (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (SI 2023/958):**

| Tonnage Band / Hazard Classification | Original Deadline | Extended Deadline |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1000+ tonnes/year OR Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, or Reprotoxic (CMR) substances OR other high hazard substances | October 27, 2023 | **October 27, 2026** |
| **100-1000 tonnes/year** | October 27, 2025 | **October 27, 2028** |
| 1-100 tonnes/year | October 27, 2027 | October 27, 2030 |

**Source:** The REACH (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (SI 2023/958) which extended all UK REACH registration deadlines by 3 years in July 2023

### Specific Deadlines for Different Import Volumes

**For importers of 100-1000 tonnes per year (including Urea at >100 tonnes/year):**
- **Registration deadline (with DUIN):** October 27, 2028
- **Time remaining:** Approximately 2 years and 11 months from November 2025

**For importers of 1000+ tonnes per year:**
- **Registration deadline (with DUIN):** October 27, 2026
- **Time remaining:** Approximately 11 months from November 2025
- **Note:** This accelerated deadline also applies to substances classified as CMR (Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, or Reprotoxic) Category 1A or 1B, or other high hazard substances, regardless of tonnage

### Consequences of Not Having a DUIN

If a company does not submit a DUIN (and is not operating under grandfathered registration or full UK REACH registration):
- Immediate registration obligation applies
- Importing substances at 1 tonne or more per year without registration violates Article 5 of UK REACH
- This constitutes a criminal offense under The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008
- The company must either register immediately or cease importing

## 3. UK REACH History and Differences from EU REACH

### How UK REACH Came About

**Pre-Brexit (Before January 1, 2021):**
The United Kingdom was a member of the European Union and subject to EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), which came into force in 2007 under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland, served as the regulatory authority for all EU member states, including the UK.

**Post-Brexit Transition:**
Following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1577) created a standalone UK REACH regime that came into effect on January 1, 2021.

**Source:** The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1577)

### Legislative Framework

UK REACH was created by copying the structure and text of EU REACH but amending it for UK-specific application:
- References to "the Agency" were changed from ECHA to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
- Geographic scope changed from "EU" to "Great Britain" (England, Scotland, Wales)
- Northern Ireland remains subject to EU REACH under the Northern Ireland Protocol
- Registration submissions now go to HSE instead of ECHA

**Regulation 2 - Interpretation (UK REACH):**
"**the Agency** means the Health and Safety Executive"

**Article 16(1) - Registration Submissions (UK REACH):**
"The registration must be submitted to **the Agency** [HSE]."

**Source:** The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020

### Key Differences Between UK REACH and EU REACH

**1. Separate Regulatory Systems**

Post-Brexit, there are now **TWO completely separate REACH regimes:**

| Feature | EU REACH | UK REACH |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Geographic Coverage** | EU27 member states | Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) |
| **Regulatory Authority** | European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) | Health and Safety Executive (HSE) |
| **Registration Location** | ECHA, Helsinki, Finland | HSE, Bootle, United Kingdom |
| **Legal Basis** | Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 | The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 |
| **Database** | ECHA public database | HSE (no public searchable database) |

**2. No Mutual Recognition**

**Critical Point:** EU REACH registrations and UK REACH registrations do **NOT** cross-recognize each other.

- A substance registered with ECHA under EU REACH can be legally imported into EU27 countries
- The same substance registered with ECHA under EU REACH **CANNOT** be legally imported into Great Britain based on that EU registration alone
- A separate UK REACH registration with HSE is required for GB imports

This means companies importing substances into both the EU and GB must maintain **two separate registrations** with two separate agencies.

**3. Transition Arrangements**

UK REACH included several transition mechanisms not present in the original EU REACH:

**Grandfathering:** Companies that held EU REACH registrations as GB-based legal entities on December 31, 2020, could transfer ("grandfather") their registrations to UK REACH by submitting basic information to HSE by April 30, 2021. These companies receive extended deadlines to submit full UK REACH data.

**DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification):** Companies that were downstream users under EU REACH (importing from EU suppliers with EU REACH registrations) could submit DUINs to defer their registration obligations. This mechanism acknowledged that Brexit converted many "downstream users" into "importers" overnight.

**Extended Deadlines:** In July 2023, the UK government extended all UK REACH registration deadlines by 3 years to reduce the burden on businesses during the transition period.

These transition mechanisms do not exist in EU REACH because EU REACH did not undergo a similar jurisdictional change.

**4. Territorial Scope**

**EU REACH:** Applies to all EU27 member states. Northern Ireland, under the Northern Ireland Protocol, remains subject to EU REACH for goods placed on the Northern Ireland market.

**UK REACH:** Applies only to Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales). Does NOT apply to Northern Ireland.

This creates a unique situation where:
- Imports into Northern Ireland require EU REACH compliance (ECHA registration)
- Imports into Great Britain require UK REACH compliance (HSE registration)
- Companies operating across both territories may need both registrations

**5. Definition of "Importer"**

**Under EU REACH (when UK was a member):**
A GB-based company importing substances from outside the EU was considered an "importer."
A GB-based company purchasing from an EU supplier with EU REACH registration was a "downstream user."

**Under UK REACH (post-Brexit):**
A GB-based company importing substances from outside GB (including from EU27) is considered an "importer."
A GB-based company purchasing from another GB supplier is a "downstream user."

**Critical Impact:** Brexit converted many GB companies from "downstream users" (no registration obligation) to "importers" (registration required). This is why the DUIN mechanism was created.

## 4. Database Searchability: ECHA vs HSE

### EU REACH Database (ECHA)

**Website:** https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances

**Searchability:** Fully public and searchable

**Features:**
- Search by substance name, CAS number, or EC number
- View registration dossiers and safety data
- See list of registered companies (though not always with full company details)
- Access tonnage band information
- Download safety data sheets and assessment reports
- View harmonized classifications
- Check authorization and restriction lists

**Example:** Searching for "Urea" or "CAS 57-13-6" in the ECHA database returns multiple EU REACH registrations with detailed information about registered tonnage bands, uses, and hazard classifications.

**Access:** Completely free and requires no account or login

### UK REACH Database (HSE)

**Website:** https://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/ (information and guidance only)

**Searchability:** **NO public searchable database exists**

**Current Status:**
As of November 2025, the HSE does not maintain a public searchable database equivalent to ECHA's registered substances database. This is a significant difference from EU REACH.

**How to Verify UK REACH Registration Status:**

Given the absence of a public database, companies must use alternative methods to verify whether substances have UK REACH registrations:

**1. Contact HSE Directly**
- **Email:** ukreach@hse.gov.uk
- **Phone:** +44 (0)203 028 3343
- **Request:** Ask HSE to confirm whether a specific substance (provide CAS number and substance name) has any UK REACH registrations on file

**2. Request Information from Suppliers**
- Ask your supplier for their UK REACH registration number
- Request a copy of the HSE confirmation document
- Verify the registration covers the tonnage band and uses relevant to your imports

**3. Engage REACH Consultants**
- Regulatory consultants specializing in UK REACH may have access to registration information
- They can verify whether registrations exist for specific substances
- They can facilitate consortium membership and data sharing

**4. Check with Industry Associations**
- Trade associations and industry groups often maintain information about UK REACH registrations for substances commonly used in their sectors
- They may coordinate consortiums for shared registration

### Why the Difference?

The difference in database availability reflects different stages of implementation:

**EU REACH:** Has been operational since 2007 (18+ years). The ECHA database was developed over many years and contains decades of registration data.

**UK REACH:** Only came into effect in January 2021 (less than 5 years ago). Many registrations are still in the transitional phase under grandfathering or DUIN arrangements, with full registrations not due until 2026-2030.

HSE may develop a public database in the future as more registrations are completed, but as of November 2025, no such database exists.

### Practical Implications

**For Importers:**
The lack of a public UK REACH database makes it more difficult to:
- Verify whether a substance you wish to import is already registered in the UK
- Identify potential consortium members for data sharing
- Conduct due diligence on supplier registration claims

**Workaround Strategies:**
- Always request written confirmation of UK REACH registration from suppliers
- Verify claims by contacting HSE directly
- Build relationships with REACH consultants who have market intelligence
- Join industry associations that coordinate REACH compliance efforts

## 5. Urea-Specific Information

### Substance Identity

**Common Name:** Urea (also known as Carbamide)

**Chemical Formula:** CH₄N₂O or CO(NH₂)₂

**CAS Number (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number):** 57-13-6

**EC Number (European Community Number):** 200-315-5

**IUPAC Name (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry):** Carbonyl diamide

**Molecular Weight:** 60.06 g/mol

### Classification and Hazard Profile

**Urea Hazard Classification:**
Urea is NOT classified as:
- Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, or Reprotoxic (CMR)
- Persistent, Bioaccumulative, or Toxic (PBT)
- Very Persistent and Very Bioaccumulative (vPvB)
- A substance of very high concern (SVHC)

Urea is generally considered a **low hazard substance** for REACH purposes, though it should be handled according to standard industrial chemical safety practices.

**Registration Priority:**
Because Urea is not a CMR or high hazard substance, its registration deadline is based purely on tonnage band, not accelerated hazard-based deadlines.

### Common Uses

Urea has widespread industrial and commercial applications:

1. **Agriculture:** Nitrogen fertilizer (largest use globally)
2. **Industrial Chemistry:**
   - Manufacture of urea-formaldehyde resins
   - Production of plastics and adhesives
   - Melamine production
3. **Automotive:** Diesel exhaust fluid (AdBlue/DEF) for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems
4. **Animal Feed:** Non-protein nitrogen source for ruminants
5. **Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics:** Moisturizing agent and skin penetration enhancer
6. **Textile Processing:** Dyeing and finishing processes
7. **Explosives:** Component in some explosive formulations

### EU REACH Registration Status

**Status:** Urea is extensively registered under EU REACH

**ECHA Database Search Results:**
- Multiple registrations exist for different tonnage bands
- Registration dossiers are publicly available on the ECHA website
- Multiple registrants hold EU REACH authorizations for various uses
- Extensive safety data and testing information is available

**Search Method:** Visit https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances and search for "Urea" or "57-13-6"

### UK REACH Registration Status

**Status:** Unknown without direct HSE verification

**Current Situation:**
- Some companies may have grandfathered registrations (if they held EU REACH registrations as GB entities before Brexit)
- Some companies may have submitted DUINs and are operating under deferred deadlines
- Some companies may have already completed full UK REACH registrations
- **However, a public searchable database does not exist to verify this information**

**How to Verify:**
Contact HSE at ukreach@hse.gov.uk and ask: "Can you confirm whether Urea (CAS 57-13-6, EC 200-315-5) has any active UK REACH registrations, and if so, can you provide guidance on whether consortium memberships are available?"

### Tonnage Band Implications for Urea Imports

**For imports of 100-1000 tonnes per year:**
- Registration deadline (with DUIN): October 27, 2028
- Data requirements: Annexes VI, VII, VIII, and IX of UK REACH
- This includes extensive toxicological and ecotoxicological testing data
- Estimated registration cost: £65,000 - £345,000 (depending on data availability and consortium participation)

**For imports of 1000+ tonnes per year:**
- Registration deadline (with DUIN): October 27, 2026
- Data requirements: Annexes VI, VII, VIII, IX, and potentially X
- Higher testing requirements and chemical safety assessment complexity
- Estimated registration cost: £100,000 - £500,000+

---

## 6. Finding UK REACH Consortiums for Urea

A consortium is a group of companies that jointly register the same substance, sharing the costs and data requirements. Joining an existing Urea consortium can significantly reduce registration costs.

### Why Consortiums Matter

**Cost Savings:**
- Test data generation for Annexes VII, VIII, and IX can cost £50,000 - £250,000+ if conducted independently
- Consortium members share these costs proportionally based on tonnage and timing of joining
- Typical consortium membership fee: £5,000 - £30,000 (far less than independent data generation)

**Legal Requirement:**
Under Article 11 of UK REACH, companies registering the same substance must share data to avoid duplicate animal testing. Consortiums formalize this data-sharing requirement.

**Efficiency:**
Consortiums coordinate the registration process, reducing individual company workload and ensuring consistent, high-quality submissions.

### Strategies for Finding UK REACH Urea Consortiums

#### 1. Contact HSE Directly

**Method:** Email ukreach@hse.gov.uk

**Suggested inquiry:**
"We are a GB-based company importing Urea (CAS 57-13-6, EC 200-315-5) at volumes exceeding 100 tonnes per year. We understand that Article 11 of UK REACH requires data sharing among registrants. Can HSE provide guidance on whether any UK REACH consortiums or substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) exist for Urea? If so, can you provide contact information or suggest how we might connect with other registrants?"

**Note:** HSE may not directly facilitate consortium formation but may be able to confirm whether registrations exist and suggest next steps.

#### 2. Search for REACH Consultancy Firms Specializing in UK REACH

Regulatory consultancies often manage consortiums on behalf of multiple companies. Search for firms with UK REACH expertise:

**Suggested UK-based REACH consultancies:**
- **Knoell UK** (www.knoell.com) - Major REACH consultancy with UK and EU operations
- **RPA Ltd** (www.rpaltd.co.uk) - UK-based REACH specialists, explicitly mention UK REACH registration services
- **ERM (Environmental Resources Management)** - Global consultancy with UK chemical regulatory expertise
- **ENVIRON (now part of Ramboll)** - Chemical compliance specialists
- **Yordas Group** - Chemical regulation and product compliance consultancy
- **Ecomundo** - Offers UK REACH registration services and consortium management

**Contact method:** Email or call these firms and ask:
"Do you manage or know of any existing UK REACH consortiums for Urea (CAS 57-13-6)? If not, can you assist with forming a new consortium or connecting us with other potential registrants?"

#### 3. Check with Trade Associations and Industry Groups

Industry associations often coordinate REACH compliance efforts for their members.

**Relevant UK Trade Associations for Urea:**

**Agricultural/Fertilizer Sector:**
- **Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC)** (www.agindustries.org.uk) - Represents UK fertilizer industry
- **Fertilizers Europe UK** - May have information on fertilizer substance registrations

**Chemical Manufacturing:**
- **Chemical Industries Association (CIA)** (www.cia.org.uk) - UK chemical industry trade body, offers REACH guidance
- **British Plastics Federation (BPF)** (www.bpf.co.uk) - For urea-formaldehyde resin manufacturers

**Automotive (DEF/AdBlue):**
- **Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)** - May have information for AdBlue (automotive urea solution) suppliers

**Contact method:** Join the relevant association(s) and ask whether they coordinate UK REACH consortiums or can connect you with other Urea importers/manufacturers.

#### 4. Search for EU REACH Urea Consortiums and Ask About UK Equivalents

**Background:** Many substances had EU REACH consortiums. Some of these may have established parallel UK REACH consortiums after Brexit.

**Method:**
1. Search the ECHA website for Urea (CAS 57-13-6) and identify companies holding EU REACH registrations
2. Identify consortium leads or substance information exchange forum (SIEF) coordinators listed in the ECHA dossiers
3. Contact these organizations to ask if they have formed or know of UK REACH consortiums

**Example search:**
Visit https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances, search "57-13-6", and look for joint submission indicators or lead registrant information.

#### 5. Network with Suppliers and Competitors

**Suppliers:**
Your current or potential GB-based suppliers may already be part of a UK REACH consortium or know of one. Ask:
"Are you aware of any UK REACH consortiums for Urea? If you are registering Urea under UK REACH, is there an opportunity to join your consortium or be added to your registration as a customer?"

**Competitors/Industry Peers:**
While competitors may not share commercial information, many are willing to discuss regulatory compliance strategies, including consortium participation. Industry conferences, trade shows, and networking events can facilitate these conversations.

#### 6. Monitor HSE and UK Government Announcements

**Sources:**
- HSE REACH webpage (www.hse.gov.uk/reach/)
- UK Government REACH guidance (www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-comply-with-reach-chemical-regulations)
- Subscribe to HSE email updates on UK REACH

HSE occasionally publishes guidance documents, Q&A sessions, or webinars that may mention consortium formation opportunities.

#### 7. Use LinkedIn and Professional Networks

**Method:**
- Search LinkedIn for "UK REACH Urea" or "UK REACH consultant"
- Join LinkedIn groups focused on UK chemical regulation or REACH compliance
- Post inquiries (if appropriate) asking for consortium contacts or consultant recommendations

**Professional networks:**
- Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) members' forums
- Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) special interest groups

#### 8. Contact the Original EU REACH Urea Consortium

If an EU REACH consortium for Urea exists, they may have expanded to offer UK REACH services or can refer you to a UK equivalent.

**Potential EU consortiums:**
Search for "Urea REACH consortium" or check with consortium management firms like:
- **REACH Consortium Management (various firms manage multiple substance consortiums)**
- **Cefic (European Chemical Industry Council)** - May have directories of consortiums

### What to Ask When Contacting Potential Consortiums

When you identify a potential UK REACH consortium for Urea, ask:

1. **Eligibility:** "Can companies join at this stage, or is membership closed?"
2. **Tonnage bands covered:** "Does the consortium cover registrations for 100-1000 tonnes/year? 1000+ tonnes/year?"
3. **Data completeness:** "Has the consortium already generated the required Annex VII, VIII, and IX data, or is data generation still in progress?"
4. **Costs:** "What is the cost of consortium membership for our tonnage band? Are there additional per-tonne fees or milestone payments?"
5. **Timeline:** "What is the consortium's timeline for submitting UK REACH registrations?"
6. **Membership requirements:** "What information and commitments are required to join the consortium?"
7. **Lead registrant:** "Who serves as the lead registrant, and what is their experience with UK REACH submissions?"

### If No Consortium Exists

If no UK REACH consortium exists for Urea (which would be surprising given its high-volume use), you have options:

**Option 1: Form a New Consortium**
A REACH consultancy can help you identify other Urea importers/manufacturers and establish a new consortium. This requires:
- Finding other companies importing/manufacturing Urea in similar tonnage bands
- Agreeing on cost-sharing arrangements
- Appointing a lead registrant
- Coordinating data generation and submission

**Option 2: Individual Registration**
Register independently, either by:
- Hiring a consultant to prepare your registration dossier
- Generating or purchasing the required toxicological and ecotoxicological data
- Submitting directly to HSE

This is significantly more expensive (£100,000 - £500,000+) but provides complete control over the registration.

### Estimated Consortium Costs for Urea

Based on typical consortium fee structures:

| Tonnage Band | Estimated Consortium Membership Fee | Timeline for Data Access |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 100-1000 t/yr | £10,000 - £30,000 | Immediate if data complete; 6-12 months if in progress |
| 1000+ t/yr | £25,000 - £60,000 | Immediate if data complete; 6-12 months if in progress |

**Note:** These are rough estimates. Actual costs depend on:
- When you join (early joiners often pay less)
- Your specific tonnage
- Complexity of your uses
- Whether additional testing is needed beyond standard Annexes

## Summary and Key Takeaways

### Most Critical Points

1. **Criminal Penalties:** UK REACH non-compliance can result in unlimited fines and up to 2 years imprisonment in Crown Court, with no "due diligence" defense available.

2. **Late DUIN Still Possible:** Companies that were importing from EU suppliers before January 1, 2021, can still submit late DUINs to defer registration until October 27, 2028 (for 100-1000 t/yr) or October 27, 2026 (for 1000+ t/yr).

3. **Separate Systems:** EU REACH and UK REACH are completely separate. EU REACH registrations do NOT satisfy UK REACH requirements for GB imports.

4. **No Public Database:** Unlike EU REACH (ECHA), UK REACH (HSE) does not have a public searchable database. Verification requires direct contact with HSE.

5. **Urea Status:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6) is a low-hazard, high-volume substance widely used in agriculture, automotive, and industrial applications. Its UK REACH registration status cannot be verified without contacting HSE.

6. **Consortium Benefits:** Joining a UK REACH consortium for Urea could reduce registration costs from £100,000-£500,000 (individual registration) to £10,000-£60,000 (consortium membership).

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify DUIN Eligibility:** Determine whether your company was importing Urea from EU suppliers before January 1, 2021. If yes, submit a late DUIN immediately.

2. **Contact HSE:** Email ukreach@hse.gov.uk to verify UK REACH registration status for Urea and ask about consortium opportunities.

3. **Engage Consultants:** Contact UK REACH consultancies (RPA Ltd, Knoell, Ecomundo, etc.) to explore consortium membership or registration support.

4. **Join Trade Associations:** Consider joining the Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) or Chemical Industries Association (CIA) for regulatory guidance and networking with other importers.

5. **Document Everything:** Gather records of import volumes, supplier information, and historical import timelines to support DUIN eligibility claims or registration submissions.
