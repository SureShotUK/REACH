**Do I Need My Own UK REACH Registration?**

## THE KEY QUESTION: Where Are You Importing From?

Your registration obligation depends on **WHERE** you import from, not whether the substance is already registered by someone else.

---

## SCENARIO 1: Importing from OUTSIDE Great Britain ❌ YOU NEED REGISTRATION

### The Law: Article 5 - "No Data, No Market"

**Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (UK REACH):**

> "Substances on their own, in mixtures or in articles shall not be manufactured in Great Britain or placed on the market unless they have been registered"

**Source:** https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2006/1907/article/5

This provision was amended for UK law by SI 2019/758 and SI 2020/1577, substituting "Great Britain" for "the Community".

**"Placing on the market"** is defined in **Article 3(12)** as:
> "Supplying or making available, whether in return for payment or free of charge, to a third party. **Import shall be deemed to be placing on the market**."

### What This Means For You

**If you import Urea from outside GB (from EU, USA, China, etc.):**

✗ **YOU are the "person placing on the market"**
✗ **YOU must ensure it has been registered** under UK REACH
✗ **The fact that someone else has registered the same substance DOES NOT help you**
✗ **Each importer needs their own registration OR must use the same registration**

### Your Options

**Option A (Recommended):** Your non-GB supplier appoints a **GB-based Only Representative (OR)**
- The OR obtains UK REACH registration on behalf of the supplier
- You can then legally import under the OR's registration
- You become a "downstream user" (see Scenario 2)

**Option B:** You obtain your own UK REACH registration as an importer
- You become the registrant
- Cost: £65,000-£345,000
- Timeline: 12-24 months

**Option C:** Join an existing registration consortium
- If other importers of Urea have formed a consortium, you can join
- Share costs and data with other registrants
- Still requires you to be a co-registrant

### The Legislation

**Regulation 11 of The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/2852):**

Establishes that it is an offence for a person to contravene a listed REACH provision (Article 5 is listed in Schedule 1).

**Regulation 12 - Penalties:**
- **Summary conviction (Magistrates Court):** Fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, or both
- **Conviction on indictment (Crown Court):** Fine or imprisonment not exceeding 2 years, or both

## SCENARIO 2: Buying from GB-Based Supplier ✓ NO REGISTRATION NEEDED

### The Law: You Are a "Downstream User"

**Article 3(13)** defines a **downstream user** as:
> "Any natural or legal person established in Great Britain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who uses a substance, either on its own or in a mixture, in the course of their industrial or professional activities."

### What This Means For You

**If you buy Urea from a GB-based company that holds UK REACH registration:**

✓ **You are a "downstream user"**
✓ **You do NOT need your own registration**
✓ **The GB supplier's registration covers your use**
✓ **You have minimal ongoing obligations**

### Your Obligations as Downstream User

**Article 37 - Downstream User Obligations:**

1. **Verify supplier has UK REACH registration** (annually)
2. **Ensure your uses are covered** by supplier's registration
3. **Implement risk management measures** per Safety Data Sheet
4. **Maintain records** for 10 years
5. **Communicate up the supply chain** if you discover new hazards

**Article 38 - Downstream User Report:**
- Required ONLY if you use the substance outside the conditions described in the supplier's registration
- Most downstream users do NOT need to file this

### No Registration Fee, No Data Requirements

As a downstream user, you:
- Pay £0 in UK REACH registration fees
- Do NOT need to generate toxicological data
- Do NOT need to prepare Chemical Safety Reports
- Simply verify supplier's registration annually

## DECISION TREE: Do I Need to Register?

```
START: Do you use Urea in GB?
    │
    ├─ NO → No UK REACH obligations
    │
    └─ YES → Do you import Urea into GB from outside GB?
           │
           ├─ NO → You buy from GB supplier?
           │       │
           │       └─ YES → You are a DOWNSTREAM USER
           │                ✓ NO registration needed
           │                ✓ Verify supplier's registration
           │                ✓ Minimal ongoing obligations
           │
           └─ YES → You import from outside GB?
                   │
                   └─ You are an IMPORTER
                      ❌ YOU NEED UK REACH REGISTRATION
                      Options:
                      A) Supplier appoints GB Only Representative
                      B) You obtain your own registration
                      C) Join existing consortium
```

## YOUR CURRENT SITUATION (Based on Assessment)

**You stated:** "Importing directly from outside GB"

**Legal Status:** You are an **IMPORTER** under UK REACH

**Registration Requirement:** ❌ **YES - YOU NEED A UK REACH REGISTRATION**

**Current Status:** ❌ **NO REGISTRATION** - This is why you are non-compliant

### Why "Urea is already registered" Doesn't Help You

Someone else's UK REACH registration for Urea does NOT allow you to import. Here's why:

**Article 5 states:** "**Substances** on their own, in mixtures or in articles shall not be manufactured in Great Britain or placed on the market **unless they have been registered**."

Each legal entity that places a substance on the market (including importers) must have a registration or use an Only Representative.

**Think of it like a driving license:**
- Just because someone else has a license to drive doesn't mean YOU can drive
- You need your OWN license OR you need to be a passenger (downstream user)

Similarly:
- Just because Urea is registered by Company X doesn't mean YOU can import
- You need YOUR OWN registration (or supplier's OR) OR you need to buy from a GB supplier (downstream user)

---

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Switch to GB Supplier

**Article 5 does NOT apply to downstream users.**

If you buy Urea from a GB-based supplier who holds UK REACH registration:
- You are NOT "placing on the market" (Article 3(12) - "import shall be deemed to be placing on the market")
- You are NOT required to register (Article 3(13) - you are a downstream user)
- The GB supplier is the entity placing on the market and THEY hold the registration

**This is why the compliance assessment recommended switching to GB supplier:**
- ✓ Fast (2-8 weeks)
- ✓ Low cost (£4k-£11k)
- ✓ Legal immediately
- ✓ No registration burden

## SUMMARY TABLE

| Your Situation | GB Import or Outside GB? | Do You Need Registration? | Legal Status |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Buy from GB supplier with UK REACH reg | GB (not import) | ✓ NO - Downstream user | Legal |

## THREE CRITICAL POINTS

### 1. Registration is Per Legal Entity, Not Per Substance
Just because "Urea is registered" by Company X does not mean YOU can import it. Each importer needs their own registration or to use an Only Representative.

### 2. "Import" = "Placing on the Market"
If you bring Urea into GB from outside GB, YOU are "placing on the market" under Article 3(12), and Article 5 applies to YOU.

### 3. Downstream Users Are Exempt
If you buy from a GB supplier (not import yourself), you are a downstream user under Article 3(13), and Article 5 does NOT require you to register.

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTION

**Based on Article 5 and your current situation (importing from outside GB):**

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **STOP importing from outside GB** - currently illegal under Article 5
2. **Identify GB-based Urea suppliers** with UK REACH registrations
3. **Engage legal counsel** to confirm your legal position

### Short-Term (2-8 Weeks)
4. **Verify GB supplier registrations** (use template: supplier_registration_verification.md)
5. **Switch to GB supplier** - become downstream user
6. **Resume legal purchases** - no registration needed

### Long-Term (Optional)
7. **Assess if own registration justified** (if GB supplier costs too high)
8. **Commission data gap analysis** (£3k-£8k)
9. **Consider joining Urea consortium** (if exists)

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SUPPLIER

### If Currently Importing From Outside GB
1. **"Do you have a GB-based Only Representative (OR) with UK REACH registration for Urea?"**
   - If YES: Get OR details and registration number → You can continue importing
   - If NO: You cannot legally import → Find GB supplier or wait for supplier to appoint OR

### If Considering GB Supplier
1. **"Do you hold a UK REACH registration for Urea?"**
2. **"What is your UK REACH registration number?"**
3. **"What tonnage band is your registration for?"**
4. **"Are my intended uses covered by your registration?"**

All four must be YES to proceed.

## BOTTOM LINE

### The Answer to Your Question

**"Does every organisation who imports the same product need to register, even if the product is already registered?"**

**Answer:**

**If you import from outside GB:** ❌ **YES** - You need your own registration (or supplier needs OR), even if Urea is already registered by others.

**If you buy from GB supplier:** ✓ **NO** - You are a downstream user, no registration needed.

**This is UK law under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (UK REACH), Article 5.**

**Your current imports from outside GB without registration are a criminal offense under The REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008, Regulation 11.**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Stop importing and switch to GB supplier (see compliance_assessment_urgent.md).**
