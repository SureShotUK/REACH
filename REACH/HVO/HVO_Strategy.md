# HVO UK REACH Compliance Strategy - Lowest Cost Pathway

**Document Date:** 11 February 2026
**Substance:** HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil)
**EC Number:** 700-571-2
**UK REACH Registration:** UK-01-9638319484-0-0004
**Critical Deadline:** 27 October 2026 (8 months remaining for ≥1000 tonnes/year)

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:** Switch to GB-based HVO supplier (Downstream User Status)

**Rationale:**
- **Lowest cost:** £0 direct compliance costs
- **Fastest implementation:** 30-60 days
- **Zero compliance burden:** Supplier handles all REACH obligations
- **Lowest risk:** No dossier preparation, submission, or HSE approval process

**Alternative Strategy (if supply chain flexibility required):** Join existing consortium

This document outlines the lowest-cost compliance strategy with detailed implementation steps.

---

## Strategy 1: Downstream User Status (RECOMMENDED - LOWEST COST)

### Overview

**Compliance Approach:** Purchase HVO from GB-based supplier who holds UK REACH registration

**Total Cost:** £0 (direct compliance costs)

**Implementation Time:** 30-60 days

**Risk Level:** LOW

### How It Works

1. **Identify GB-based HVO suppliers** with active UK REACH registrations
2. **Switch sourcing** from current non-GB suppliers to GB suppliers
3. **Become "downstream user"** instead of "importer" in regulatory terms
4. **No registration required** - rely on supplier's registration

### Requirements

**From Supplier:**
- Active UK REACH registration for HVO (EC 700-571-2)
- Registration number on Safety Data Sheet
- Confirmation your uses are covered by their registered uses
- Exposure scenarios and risk management measures

**From Your Company:**
- Use HVO in accordance with supplier's identified uses
- Implement recommended risk management measures
- Maintain records (Safety Data Sheets, usage, suppliers)
- No dossier preparation or HSE submission required

### Cost Analysis

**Direct Costs:** £0

**Potential Indirect Costs:**
- Price differential between GB and non-GB suppliers (variable)
- Likely range: £0 - £50 per tonne premium
- For 1000 tonnes/year: £0 - £50,000/year

**5-Year Total:** £0 - £250,000 (depending on supplier pricing)

**Note:** Even with maximum price premium, this is competitive with consortium membership costs when considering administrative burden.

### Advantages

✓ Zero compliance costs
✓ No regulatory submissions
✓ No dossier preparation
✓ No HSE approval process
✓ Fastest implementation
✓ Simplest ongoing compliance
✓ Supplier handles all REACH obligations
✓ No deadline pressure
✓ No SME status verification needed
✓ No Letter of Access negotiations

### Disadvantages

✗ Dependent on supplier maintaining registration
✗ Limited to supplier's identified uses
✗ Potential price premium
✗ Reduced supply chain flexibility
✗ Must switch if supplier exits market

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Supplier Identification (Week 1-2)

**Identify Potential GB-based HVO Suppliers:**

Known UK-based suppliers likely to have UK REACH registrations:
- **Greenergy** (UK-based, documentation references EC 700-571-2)
- **Crown Oil** (UK distributor)
- **Certas Energy** (UK distributor)
- **Nationwide Fuels** (UK distributor)
- **Watson Fuels** (UK distributor)

**Action Steps:**
1. Contact each supplier's commercial team
2. Request the following information:
   - Do they hold a UK REACH registration for HVO (EC 700-571-2)?
   - What is their UK REACH registration number?
   - What uses are covered by their registration?
   - Can they provide Safety Data Sheets with UK REACH registration number?
   - What are their prices, delivery terms, and volumes available?

**Required Information Template:**
```
Dear [Supplier],

We are currently importing HVO and need to ensure UK REACH compliance
before the October 2026 deadline. To qualify as a downstream user under
UK REACH, we require:

1. Confirmation that you hold a UK REACH registration for HVO
   (EC number 700-571-2)
2. Your UK REACH registration number
3. Safety Data Sheet including:
   - UK REACH registration number
   - Identified uses
   - Exposure scenarios
   - Risk management measures
4. Confirmation that our use case [describe your use] is covered by
   your registration
5. Commercial terms (pricing, volume capacity, delivery)

Please provide this information by [date].

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

#### Phase 2: Supplier Evaluation (Week 2-3)

**Evaluate Responses:**

Create comparison matrix:

| Supplier | UK REACH Registration? | Registration Number | Uses Covered | Price/tonne | Volume Capacity | Delivery Terms | Total Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Greenergy | | | | | | | |
| Crown Oil | | | | | | | |
| Certas Energy | | | | | | | |
| Nationwide | | | | | | | |
| Watson | | | | | | | |

**Scoring Criteria:**
- UK REACH compliance: PASS/FAIL (mandatory)
- Uses covered: PASS/FAIL (mandatory)
- Price: 40 points (lower = higher score)
- Volume capacity: 30 points (higher = higher score)
- Delivery terms: 20 points
- Service level: 10 points

**Decision Criteria:**
1. Must have active UK REACH registration (non-negotiable)
2. Must cover your use case (non-negotiable)
3. Sufficient volume capacity for your needs
4. Competitive pricing vs. current supplier + compliance costs
5. Acceptable delivery terms and service levels

#### Phase 3: Commercial Negotiation (Week 3-4)

**Negotiate Terms:**
1. **Baseline Comparison:**
   - Current non-GB supplier price: £___/tonne
   - Estimated consortium compliance cost amortized: £15-40/tonne (over 5 years)
   - **Acceptable GB supplier price:** Current price + £15-40/tonne

2. **Negotiation Points:**
   - Volume commitment (1000+ tonnes/year)
   - Multi-year contract (2-3 years) for price stability
   - Delivery schedule and logistics
   - Quality guarantees (EN 15940 compliance)
   - Sustainability certification (ISCC/RSB)
   - Payment terms
   - Force majeure and supply security provisions

3. **Contract Terms to Include:**
   - Supplier's obligation to maintain UK REACH registration
   - Supplier's obligation to notify if registration status changes
   - Supplier's obligation to provide updated Safety Data Sheets
   - Right to terminate if supplier loses registration
   - Provision of exposure scenarios and risk management measures

#### Phase 4: Implementation (Week 4-6)

**Steps:**
1. Sign supply agreement with selected GB supplier
2. Phase out non-GB supplier:
   - Complete current orders
   - Do not place new orders
   - Transition inventory management
3. Receive and review:
   - Safety Data Sheets with UK REACH registration number
   - Exposure scenarios
   - Risk management measures
4. Update internal systems:
   - Procurement records
   - Inventory management
   - Safety documentation
   - Supplier database
5. Train staff on:
   - New supplier details
   - Risk management measures
   - Downstream user obligations
6. Notify customers (if applicable):
   - Updated Safety Data Sheets
   - No change to product specifications
   - Continued UK REACH compliance

#### Phase 5: Ongoing Compliance (Continuous)

**Downstream User Obligations:**

1. **Record Keeping (10 years):**
   - Safety Data Sheets from supplier
   - Quantities purchased and used
   - Supplier information
   - Customer communications (if reselling)

2. **Risk Management:**
   - Implement measures from supplier's exposure scenarios
   - Document implementation
   - Train personnel on safe handling

3. **Supply Chain Communication:**
   - Pass Safety Data Sheets downstream (if applicable)
   - Notify supplier if your use changes or is outside identified uses
   - Report any incidents or new hazard information

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Verify supplier maintains UK REACH registration (annual check)
   - Ensure Safety Data Sheets remain current
   - Review exposure scenarios if operations change

**Annual Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Confirm supplier still holds UK REACH registration
- [ ] Safety Data Sheets up to date and contain UK REACH registration number
- [ ] Uses still covered by supplier's registration
- [ ] Risk management measures implemented and effective
- [ ] Records maintained and accessible
- [ ] No changes to operations requiring notification

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Supplier loses UK REACH registration**
- **Mitigation:** Include contract clause requiring notification; maintain relationship with backup GB supplier
- **Likelihood:** LOW (major suppliers will maintain registrations)
- **Impact:** HIGH (would require emergency switch or registration)

**Risk: Supplier increases prices significantly**
- **Mitigation:** Multi-year contract with price caps; maintain awareness of market prices
- **Likelihood:** MODERATE
- **Impact:** MODERATE (still likely cheaper than independent registration)

**Risk: Supplier exits market**
- **Mitigation:** Monitor supplier financial health; have backup supplier identified
- **Likelihood:** LOW
- **Impact:** HIGH (would require supplier switch or registration)

**Risk: Your use case not covered by supplier's registration**
- **Mitigation:** Clearly document and communicate your use case upfront; obtain written confirmation
- **Likelihood:** LOW (fuel uses typically well-covered)
- **Impact:** HIGH (would require downstream user notification or registration)

### Success Criteria

**Compliance Achieved When:**
- ✓ Supply agreement signed with GB-based supplier holding UK REACH registration
- ✓ Safety Data Sheets received showing UK REACH registration number
- ✓ Confirmation received that your uses are covered
- ✓ Exposure scenarios and risk management measures implemented
- ✓ First delivery received from GB supplier
- ✓ Non-GB supplier phased out
- ✓ Records system established for downstream user obligations

**Target Date:** 1 May 2026 (5 months before deadline)

## Strategy 2: Join Existing Consortium (ALTERNATIVE)

### Overview

**When to Use This Strategy:**
- GB supplier pricing is prohibitively high (>£100/tonne premium)
- Supply chain flexibility is critical business requirement
- Multiple non-GB suppliers needed for security
- Strategic reasons to maintain direct import capability

**Total Cost:** £15,000 - £40,000 (upfront) + £0 - £5,000/year (ongoing)

**Implementation Time:** 4-6 months

**Risk Level:** MODERATE

### Cost Breakdown

**One-Time Costs:**
- Letter of Access: £8,000 - £20,000 (€10,000 - €25,000)
- HSE Registration Fee: £57 - £2,222 (depending on SME status)
- Analytical Testing: £650 - £1,000
- Consultant Support: £5,000 - £15,000
- **Total: £15,000 - £40,000**

**Annual Costs:**
- Consortium membership (if applicable): £1,000 - £5,000
- Registration updates (if tonnage changes): £57 - £2,222

**5-Year Total:** £15,000 - £65,000

### Implementation Plan (Summary)

**Month 1: Preparation**
- Engage REACH consultant (£5,000 - £15,000)
- Determine SME status for fee reductions
- Contact HSE to verify DUIN status
- Identify lead registrant/consortium for HVO

**Month 2-3: Negotiation & Dossier Prep**
- Negotiate Letter of Access (€10,000 - €25,000)
- Conduct analytical testing (£650 - £1,000)
- Prepare IUCLID dossier with consultant
- Document uses, exposure scenarios, risk management

**Month 4: Submission**
- Create Comply with UK REACH account
- Submit registration dossier
- Pay HSE fee (£57 - £2,222 based on SME status)

**Month 5-6: Approval**
- HSE reviews submission (1-3 months)
- Respond to any questions or completeness checks
- Receive UK REACH registration number

**Target Completion:** 1 August 2026 (2 months before deadline)

### Advantages Over Downstream User Status

✓ Maintain supply chain flexibility (multiple suppliers)
✓ Own registration independence
✓ No dependency on single supplier
✓ Strategic control over compliance
✓ Can switch suppliers without compliance impact

### Disadvantages vs. Downstream User Status

✗ Significant upfront costs (£15k - £40k)
✗ Ongoing consortium fees possible
✗ Administrative burden (dossier preparation)
✗ HSE approval required (1-3 months)
✗ Deadline pressure (4-6 month process)
✗ Requires consultant expertise
✗ More complex ongoing compliance

### When to Choose This Strategy

Choose consortium membership if:
- GB supplier premium > £40/tonne AND high volume (>1000 tonnes)
- Supply security requires multiple international suppliers
- Strategic importance of direct import capability
- Business growth expected requiring higher tonnage bands
- Long-term import operations planned (>10 years)

**Cost Comparison Example (1000 tonnes/year, 5 years):**

| Scenario | Downstream User | Consortium |
|---|---|---|
| GB supplier premium: £10/tonne | £50,000 | £20,000 |
| GB supplier premium: £30/tonne | £150,000 | £20,000 |
| GB supplier premium: £50/tonne | £250,000 | £20,000 |

If GB supplier premium < £30/tonne, downstream user status is more cost-effective.
If GB supplier premium > £40/tonne, consortium membership is more cost-effective.

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Determine Import Volume and Deadline

| Annual Import Volume | Applicable Deadline | Urgency Level |
|---|---|---|
| ≥1000 tonnes/year | **27 October 2026** | **CRITICAL (8 months)** |
| 100-1000 tonnes/year | 27 October 2028 | Moderate (2.5 years) |
| 1-100 tonnes/year | 27 October 2030 | Low (4.5 years) |

**Action:** Calculate your annual HVO import volume → Determine deadline → Assess urgency

### Step 2: Identify GB Supplier Options

**Action:** Contact potential GB suppliers (see Strategy 1, Phase 1)

**Key Questions:**
1. Do any GB suppliers have UK REACH registration for HVO?
2. What is the price differential vs. current non-GB suppliers?
3. Can they supply your required volume?

### Step 3: Decision Tree

```
START: Do you import HVO from non-GB sources?
│
├─ YES → Are GB suppliers available with UK REACH registration?
│   │
│   ├─ YES → Is price premium acceptable (<£40/tonne)?
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ YES → CHOOSE: Downstream User Status (Strategy 1)
│   │   │         Reason: Lowest cost, simplest compliance
│   │   │
│   │   └─ NO → Is supply chain flexibility critical?
│   │       │
│   │       ├─ YES → CHOOSE: Join Consortium (Strategy 2)
│   │       │         Reason: Cost-effective vs. high price premium
│   │       │
│   │       └─ NO → Reconsider GB supplier price premium
│   │                or negotiate better terms
│   │
│   └─ NO → MUST CHOOSE: Join Consortium (Strategy 2)
│             Reason: No downstream user option available
│
└─ NO → You are already a downstream user - NO ACTION NEEDED
          (Verify supplier has UK REACH registration)
```

### Step 4: Budget Approval

**For Downstream User Strategy:**
- Budget: £0 direct compliance costs
- Potential: £0 - £50,000/year price differential
- Approval level: Procurement decision

**For Consortium Strategy:**
- Budget: £15,000 - £40,000 upfront
- Ongoing: £0 - £5,000/year
- Approval level: Capital expenditure or compliance budget

### Step 5: Timeline Planning

**Critical Path for ≥1000 tonnes/year (Deadline: 27 Oct 2026):**

| Strategy | Start Date | Completion Date | Buffer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Downstream User | 11 Feb 2026 | 1 May 2026 | 5 months |
| Consortium | 11 Feb 2026 | 1 Aug 2026 | 2 months |

**Recommendation:** Start immediately regardless of chosen strategy to maintain deadline buffer.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Downstream User Strategy (RECOMMENDED)

**Benefits:**
- Zero direct compliance costs
- Fast implementation (6-8 weeks)
- No regulatory approval needed
- Minimal administrative burden
- Lowest risk of missing deadline

**Costs:**
- Potential supplier price premium: £0 - £50/tonne
- For 1000 tonnes/year: £0 - £50,000/year
- 5-year total: £0 - £250,000

**Net Benefit:**
Even with maximum price premium (£50/tonne), total 5-year cost (£250,000) is competitive with consortium membership when considering:
- Zero upfront capital
- No consultant fees
- No deadline pressure
- No administrative time
- No HSE approval uncertainty

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Consortium upfront cost: £20,000 (midpoint)
- Break-even supplier premium: £20,000 ÷ 1000 tonnes ÷ 5 years = £4/tonne
- If GB supplier premium < £4/tonne → Downstream user clearly better
- If GB supplier premium > £40/tonne → Consortium clearly better
- Range £4-40/tonne → Consider other factors (flexibility, admin burden)

### Recommendation Confidence

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (>90%):** Downstream user status is optimal if:
- GB suppliers available with UK REACH registration
- Price premium < £30/tonne
- Single supplier acceptable for supply security
- Deadline urgency (≥1000 tonnes/year with Oct 2026 deadline)

**MODERATE CONFIDENCE (70-90%):** Consortium membership is optimal if:
- No GB suppliers available, OR
- GB supplier premium > £40/tonne, OR
- Supply chain flexibility is critical business requirement

**LOW CONFIDENCE (<70%):** Independent registration (never recommended for HVO)
