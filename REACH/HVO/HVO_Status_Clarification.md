# HVO DUIN Status Clarification

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do we qualify for DUIN as a company or per substance?**
- **A:** Per substance. Your DUIN for Urea only covers Urea.

**Q: Do we have to register before we can import HVO?**
- **A:** YES, if importing from non-GB suppliers. NO, if purchasing from GB suppliers (downstream user).

**Q: Can we defer registration because we are DUIN for Urea?**
- **A:** NO. DUIN for Urea does not give you any deferral for HVO.

**Q: Is there time to import before we have to register?**
- **A:** NO grace period for new substances. You must register BEFORE importing ≥1 tonne/year from non-GB sources.

## Recommended Action

**Based on your situation (Small SME, 1-100 tonnes/year, new substance):**

### IMMEDIATE OPTION (Can start importing now):

1. Contact GB-based HVO suppliers this week
2. Verify they hold UK REACH registration for HVO
3. Switch sourcing to GB supplier
4. Import immediately as downstream user
5. No registration needed

**Supplier contacts to try:**
- Greenergy (UK-based, likely has registration)
- Crown Oil
- Certas Energy
- Nationwide Fuels

### ALTERNATIVE (If GB suppliers unavailable/uneconomical):

1. Begin consortium registration process (4-6 months)
2. Do NOT import until registration complete
3. Risk: Cannot import during 4-6 month registration period
