| Analytical Testing | £650 - £1,000 | Industry standard |
| REACH Consultant (optional) | £3,000 - £8,000 | Industry estimate |
| **TOTAL (with consultant)** | **£6,049 - £17,399** | |

## 6-Step Process

### Step 1: Verify DUIN Status (Week 1)

**DUIN** (Downstream User Import Notification) provides transitional registration benefits until your deadline.

**Check if submitted:**
- Contact HSE UK REACH IT Support: **ukreachitsupport@defra.gov.uk**
- Reference HVO EC number 700-571-2
- Request confirmation of DUIN submission status

**If NOT submitted:**
Late submissions may still be accepted. HSE states: *"If you did not notify HSE and wish to continue to import EU REACH registered substances into Great Britain at or above one tonne per year, you can still submit a notification, if eligible to do so, as soon as possible."*

**Expected Cost Range:** £2,000 - £8,000 for low tonnage band

**Legal Requirement:** LoA must be offered on *"fair, transparent and non-discriminatory terms"*.
