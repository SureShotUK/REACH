# HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) - UK REACH Research Summary

**Research Date:** 11 February 2026
**Substance:** Renewable Hydrocarbons (Diesel type fraction)
**Commercial Name:** HVO - Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil
**EC Number:** 700-571-2
**CAS Number:** 928771-01-1
**UK REACH Registration Number:** UK-01-9638319484-0-0004

## Executive Summary

HVO is **already registered under UK REACH** with an active registration. UK businesses importing HVO from non-GB sources must either:
1. Hold their own UK REACH registration
2. Reference an existing registration (join consortium)
3. Switch to GB-based suppliers (become downstream user)

**CRITICAL DEADLINE:** 27 October 2026 (8 months remaining) for substances imported at ≥1000 tonnes/year.

## 2. Classification and Hazards

### UK CLP Classification

**Hazard Classes:**
- **Flammable Liquid Category 3** - H226: Flammable liquid and vapour
- **Aspiration Toxicity Category 1** - H304: May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways
- **EUH066:** Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking

**Signal Word:** DANGER

**Labeling Requirements:**
- GHS02 Pictogram (Flame)
- GHS08 Pictogram (Health hazard)
- Precautionary statements: P301+P310, P331, P405

**Safety Data Sheets Required:**
- UK REACH Annex II format (16 sections)
- Must reference UK REACH registration number
- Must include exposure scenarios

---

## 3. Importer Obligations

### Who is an Importer?

**You are an IMPORTER if:**
- You import HVO into GB (England, Scotland, Wales) from:
  - EU/EEA countries
  - Northern Ireland
  - Rest of world
- You import ≥1 tonne per year

**Important:** Post-Brexit, UK businesses that previously purchased from EU suppliers as "downstream users" are now classified as **importers** with new registration obligations.

### Core Obligations

1. **Valid UK REACH Registration** - Must hold or reference registration for imported tonnage band
2. **Supply Chain Communication** - Provide Safety Data Sheets downstream
3. **Record Keeping** - Maintain 10-year records of:
   - Substance identity
   - Import quantities
   - Suppliers and customers
   - Safety information
4. **Compliance with Restrictions** - No current restrictions for HVO

---

## 4. Compliance Deadlines

### Transitional Registration Deadlines

| Tonnage Band / Hazard | Deadline |
|---|---|
| **≥1000 tonnes/year** | **27 October 2026** (8 months away) |
| ≥100 tonnes/year OR CMR/H400/H410 ≥1 tonne/year | 27 October 2028 |
| 1-100 tonnes/year | 27 October 2030 |

### DUIN Status

**DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification):**
- Original deadline: 27 October 2021
- Late submissions may still be accepted by HSE
- Provides transitional registration benefits until tonnage band deadline

**Action Required:**
- Verify if DUIN was submitted for your company
- Contact HSE if DUIN was not submitted to discuss late submission eligibility

---

## 5. Renewable Fuels Regulatory Context

### Dual Compliance Required

**UK REACH (Chemical Safety):**
- Registration requirements for substances ≥1 tonne/year
- Administered by HSE
- Focus: hazards, safe use, supply chain communication

**RTFO (Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation):**
- Sustainability certification requirements
- Administered by Department for Transport (DfT)
- Focus: greenhouse gas savings, sustainable sourcing

**These are SEPARATE frameworks - BOTH required for HVO import**

### Sustainability Certification

HVO must be certified under recognized schemes:
- **ISCC EU** (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification) - Most common (92.4% of UK renewable fuel)
- **RSB** (Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials)
- **Zemo RFAS** (UK-specific voluntary scheme)

### Fuel Quality Standards

- **EN 15940** - European standard for paraffinic diesel fuels
- HVO meets this standard for drop-in diesel replacement
- Fuel Quality Directive 2009/30/EC (retained UK law)

---

## 6. Compliance Pathway Options

### Option 1: Downstream User Status (GB Supplier)

**How it Works:**
- Purchase HVO from GB-based supplier with UK REACH registration
- Become "downstream user" instead of "importer"

**Cost:** £0 (may be reflected in product pricing)

**Advantages:**
- Zero compliance burden
- Fastest implementation (30-60 days)
- Supplier handles all REACH obligations

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential price premium
- Dependency on supplier maintaining registration
- Reduced supply chain flexibility

**Suitability:** HIGH - Simplest option

---

### Option 2: Join Existing Consortium

**How it Works:**
- Purchase Letter of Access to reference existing registration data
- Submit member registration dossier via IUCLID
- Pay HSE registration fee

**Costs:**
- **Letter of Access:** £8,000 - £20,000 (€10,000 - €25,000)
- **HSE Fee:** £2,222 (standard) or £57-£740 (SME rates)
- **Analytical Testing:** £650 - £1,000
- **Consultant Support:** £5,000 - £15,000
- **TOTAL: £15,000 - £40,000 upfront**

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Consortium membership (if applicable): £1,000 - £5,000/year

**Advantages:**
- Maintains supply chain flexibility
- Industry-standard approach
- Own registration independence
- Significantly cheaper than independent registration

**Disadvantages:**
- Upfront costs
- Must negotiate with consortium
- Administrative burden (dossier preparation)

**Suitability:** VERY HIGH - Recommended for importers ≥1000 tonnes/year

**Timeline:** 4-6 months

---

### Option 3: Only Representative Arrangement

**How it Works:**
- Non-GB supplier appoints GB-based Only Representative (OR)
- OR handles all importer obligations
- Importer becomes downstream user

**Costs:**
- OR services: £5,000 - £30,000/year (typically passed through in pricing)
- Registration costs borne by OR/supplier

**Advantages:**
- No direct importer registration burden
- Supplier maintains customer relationships
- Multiple importers benefit from same OR

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires supplier cooperation
- Significant annual costs
- Limited control over registration
- Dependency on supplier's OR arrangement

**Suitability:** MODERATE - Depends on supplier willingness

---

### Option 4: Independent Registration

**How it Works:**
- Complete entirely independent UK REACH registration
- Generate or purchase all required data

**Costs:**
- **Data generation:** £100,000 - £500,000+
- **Consultant support:** £20,000 - £100,000+
- **HSE fee:** £2,222
- **Chemical Safety Report:** £10,000 - £50,000
- **TOTAL: £130,000 - £650,000+**

**Advantages:**
- Complete control
- Own data ownership

**Disadvantages:**
- Extremely expensive
- Time-consuming (12-24 months)
- Legally required to seek data sharing first
- Commercially unjustifiable

**Suitability:** VERY LOW - NOT RECOMMENDED (HVO already registered)

## 7. Cost Comparison (5-Year Total)

| Pathway | Upfront Cost | Annual Cost | 5-Year Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Downstream User (GB supplier)** | £0 | £0* | £0* |
| **Join Consortium** | £15,000 - £40,000 | £0 - £5,000 | £15,000 - £65,000 |
| **Only Representative** | £0** | £5,000 - £30,000 | £25,000 - £150,000 |
| **Independent Registration*** | £130,000 - £650,000+ | £5,000 - £20,000 | £155,000 - £750,000+ |

*May be reflected in product pricing
**Costs typically passed through by supplier
***Not recommended

## 8. SME Fee Reductions

UK REACH provides significant fee reductions for Small and Medium Enterprises:

| Enterprise Type | Registration Fee | Tonnage Update Fee |
|---|---|---|
| Standard (large) | £2,222 | £2,222 |
| Medium (<250 employees, ≤€50m turnover) | £740 | £1,249 |
| Small (<50 employees, ≤€10m turnover) | £399 | £672 |
| Micro (<10 employees, ≤€2m turnover) | £57 | £96 |

**Action:** Self-certify SME status when submitting registration for substantial savings.
