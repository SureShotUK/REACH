## Disclosure of Current Situation

We have recently conducted a compliance review of our UK REACH obligations and have identified that we may not be in full compliance with UK REACH requirements.

**Current Status:**
- We are currently importing Urea directly from [non-GB/GB] suppliers
- We have [not submitted/do not believe we have submitted] a DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)
- We [do not hold/are not aware of holding] a grandfathered EU REACH registration
- We [do not have/are not aware of having] a UK REACH registration for Urea
- We import [X] tonnes per year of Urea (>100 tonnes/year tonnage band)

**Corrective Actions Taken:**
- We have [stopped/will immediately stop] importing Urea as of [date]
- We are engaging legal counsel and REACH regulatory consultants
- We are researching GB-based suppliers with UK REACH registrations
- We are committed to achieving full compliance as quickly as possible

## Request for Guidance

We respectfully request HSE's guidance on the following:

1. **Compliance Pathways:**
   - What is the appropriate route for us to come into compliance given our situation?
   - Are there any transitional provisions or grace periods that may apply to our circumstances?
   - Should we pursue switching to a GB-based supplier (downstream user route) or submit our own registration?

2. **Voluntary Disclosure:**
   - Does our voluntary disclosure affect any potential enforcement actions?
   - Are there any specific procedures or forms we should complete for voluntary disclosure?
   - What information does HSE require from us to assess our situation?

3. **Timeline:**
   - What is a reasonable timeline for achieving compliance?
   - Can we resume imports once we have engaged a GB supplier with valid registration?
   - Are there interim measures we should take?

4. **Documentation:**
   - What records should we maintain going forward?
   - Are there specific templates or formats HSE recommends for compliance documentation?

5. **Downstream User Route:**
   - If we switch to a GB-based supplier with UK REACH registration, what verification is required?
   - What documentation should we obtain from the supplier?
   - Are there specific downstream user obligations we should be aware of?

## Commitment to Compliance

We wish to emphasize our commitment to full compliance with UK REACH. Our non-compliance was not intentional, but rather resulted from [insufficient understanding of/gaps in our knowledge of] the requirements following the transition from EU REACH to UK REACH.

We are prepared to:
- Take all necessary steps to achieve compliance promptly
- Cease importing until compliance is established
- Cooperate fully with HSE throughout this process
- Implement robust compliance management systems to prevent future issues

## Request for Meeting or Call

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss our situation with HSE in more detail, either by phone or video conference, to ensure we fully understand the compliance pathway and requirements.

**Preferred contact method:** [Phone/Email/Video call]
**Availability:** [Provide some options for timing]

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your guidance and to working cooperatively with HSE to achieve full compliance.

Yours sincerely,

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - Information Request (Without Full Disclosure)

If legal counsel advises a more cautious approach, consider this alternative template that seeks information without explicitly admitting non-compliance:

---

**To:** ukreach@hse.gov.uk

**Subject:** UK REACH Compliance Inquiry - Urea Imports

Dear HSE UK REACH Team,

I am writing on behalf of [COMPANY NAME] to request guidance on our UK REACH obligations for importing Urea.

**Background:**
- We import Urea (CAS 57-13-6) into Great Britain
- Import volume: [X] tonnes per year
- We are reviewing our compliance status and seeking to confirm our obligations

**Questions:**

1. What are the UK REACH registration requirements for companies importing >100 tonnes/year of Urea?
2. If we purchase Urea from a GB-based supplier who holds a UK REACH registration, what are our obligations as a downstream user?
3. What documentation should we maintain to demonstrate compliance?
4. How can we verify that a supplier's UK REACH registration is valid and covers our uses?

We are committed to ensuring full compliance with UK REACH and would appreciate your guidance.

Thank you for your assistance.

Yours sincerely,

**This alternative is less risky legally but provides less information to HSE and may not be seen as cooperative.**

**Legal counsel should decide which approach is appropriate for your situation.**
