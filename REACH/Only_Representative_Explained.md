# Only Representative (OR) - UK REACH Explained

**Document Purpose:** Understanding the Only Representative option and how it affects your import obligations

**Your Situation:** SME importing >1000 tonnes/year Urea from non-GB suppliers

**Date Created:** November 6, 2025

---

## What is an Only Representative (OR)?

An **Only Representative (OR)** is a **GB-based legal entity** (company or individual) appointed by a **non-GB manufacturer** to fulfill UK REACH registration obligations on the manufacturer's behalf.

### The Basic Concept

**Without an Only Representative:**
```
Non-GB Manufacturer → YOU (GB Importer) → GB Customers
                      ↑
                      YOU must register under UK REACH
                      (You are the REACH "importer")
```

**With an Only Representative:**
```
Non-GB Manufacturer → Only Representative (OR) → YOU (GB Importer) → GB Customers
                      ↑                          ↑
                      OR registers                YOU are "downstream user"
                      (OR is the REACH "importer") (NO registration needed)
```

### Key Point

**If your supplier has appointed an OR, YOU are NOT the importer under UK REACH.**

You become a **downstream user** with NO registration obligation.

---

## Who is an Only Representative?

### Legal Requirements

An Only Representative must be:

✓ **Located in Great Britain** (England, Scotland, Wales)
- Must have a GB business address
- Northern Ireland follows different rules (has access to EU REACH system)

✓ **A legal entity or natural person**
- Can be a company, individual, or consultancy
- Must be legally registered to operate in GB

✓ **Appointed in writing** by the non-GB manufacturer
- Formal appointment agreement required
- OR acts as manufacturer's legal representative for REACH

✓ **Technically and financially capable**
- Must be able to fulfill REACH obligations
- Responsible for registration, updates, HSE communication

### What an OR is NOT

❌ The OR is NOT your supplier's sales agent
❌ The OR is NOT a freight forwarder or logistics company
❌ The OR is NOT an importer (in the traditional sense)
❌ The OR is NOT your employee or consultant

**The OR represents the non-GB manufacturer, NOT you (the importer).**

---

## Who Appoints an Only Representative?

### The Appointer: Non-GB Manufacturer

**Only the manufacturer can appoint an OR, not you (the importer).**

**Who can appoint an OR:**
- ✓ EU-based manufacturers (France, Germany, Netherlands, etc.)
- ✓ Non-EU manufacturers (China, USA, India, etc.)
- ✓ Any manufacturer **outside Great Britain**

**Who CANNOT appoint an OR:**
- ❌ GB-based manufacturers (they're already in GB, don't need OR)
- ❌ You (the importer) cannot appoint OR for your supplier
- ❌ Northern Ireland-based entities (complex - NI has special status)

### Your Role (GB Importer)

**You do NOT appoint the OR.**

**Your role is to:**
1. Ask your supplier: "Have you appointed a UK Only Representative for Urea?"
2. If yes: Request OR details and registration confirmation
3. If no: YOU must register as the importer (your current situation)

**You cannot force your supplier to appoint an OR.**

---

## EU Suppliers vs Non-EU Suppliers - Any Difference?

### Short Answer: NO DIFFERENCE under UK REACH

From the perspective of **UK REACH**, there is **absolutely no difference** between EU and non-EU suppliers.

### Why No Difference?

**UK REACH Definition:**
- **"Non-GB"** = anything outside Great Britain
- EU = non-GB
- USA = non-GB
- China = non-GB
- Switzerland = non-GB

**All are treated identically.**

### Detailed Comparison

| Factor | EU Supplier (e.g., Germany) | Non-EU Supplier (e.g., China) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Status under UK REACH** | Non-GB manufacturer | Non-GB manufacturer |
| **Can appoint GB-based OR?** | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| **Process to appoint OR** | Identical | Identical |
| **OR requirements** | Same | Same |
| **If no OR appointed** | GB importer must register | GB importer must register |
| **Cost to appoint OR** | Similar | Similar |

**There is NO difference in treatment, obligations, or process.**

## The Critical Change: Brexit Impact

### Before Brexit (Pre-2021)

**If you imported Urea from EU supplier (e.g., Netherlands):**

```
EU Manufacturer (Netherlands) → YOU (GB company) → GB Customers
        ↑                            ↑
    Has EU REACH                 Downstream user
    registration                 (NO registration needed)
```

**You were a "downstream user" under EU REACH** because:
- The supply chain was entirely within the EU regulatory area
- Manufacturer had EU REACH registration
- You purchased from within the EU system

---

### After Brexit (2021 onwards)

**Same supply chain, but NOW:**

```
EU Manufacturer (Netherlands) → YOU (GB importer) → GB Customers
        ↑                              ↑
    EU REACH registration          NOW you are "IMPORTER"
    (not valid for UK)             (MUST register under UK REACH)
```

**You became an "importer" under UK REACH** because:
- ❌ EU REACH registrations do NOT apply to UK
- ❌ Bringing substance from EU into GB = importing
- ✓ YOU are the first entity in GB supply chain
- ✓ YOU must register (or your supplier must appoint OR)

**This is why you need DUIN and UK REACH registration.**

---

## How Your Supplier COULD Use an Only Representative

### Option 1: Your Supplier Appoints GB-Based OR

**If your EU supplier appointed a GB-based OR:**

```
EU Manufacturer → OR (in GB) → YOU (GB company) → GB Customers
       ↑               ↑              ↑
   Manufactures    Registers      Downstream user
   in EU           under UK REACH  (NO registration)
```

**What changes for YOU:**
- ✓ You are NO LONGER the importer (legally)
- ✓ You become a "downstream user"
- ✓ NO UK REACH registration obligation
- ✓ NO DUIN needed
- ✓ No registration costs for you
- ✓ But OR costs passed to you in product pricing

**What your supplier must do:**
- Appoint and pay GB-based OR company (typically £10,000-£40,000)
- OR registers Urea under UK REACH
- OR maintains registration
- OR handles HSE communication

---

### Option 2: Your Supplier Does NOT Appoint OR (Current Situation)

**Your current situation:**

```
EU Manufacturer → YOU (GB importer) → GB Customers
                       ↑
                   YOU must register
                   (DUIN + full registration)
```

**What this means for YOU:**
- ✓ You ARE the importer under UK REACH
- ✓ You MUST register (or stop importing)
- ✓ DUIN eligible (defers deadline to October 2028)
- ✓ Registration costs: £35,000-£50,000
- ✓ You control registration (data, consultant, timeline)

**Why your supplier may not appoint OR:**
- Costs money (£10,000-£40,000+ per substance)
- They may have few GB customers (not worth it)
- They may not understand UK REACH
- They may expect customers to handle registration

## Cost Comparison: OR vs You Registering

### Scenario A: Supplier Appoints OR

**Supplier's Costs:**
| Cost Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| OR appointment and services | £15,000 - £40,000 |
| UK REACH registration (via OR) | £30,000 - £60,000 |
| Annual OR fees | £3,000 - £10,000/year |
| **Total (first year)** | **£48,000 - £110,000** |

**Passed to Customers:**
- Supplier spreads costs across ALL GB customers
- Small price increase per tonne (depends on supplier's GB volume)
- You pay indirectly through higher product prices

**Your Direct Costs:**
- £0 registration
- Price increase per tonne: £_____ (typically small if supplier has many GB customers)

**Advantages for You:**
- ✓ No registration burden
- ✓ No consultant/consortium costs
- ✓ No HSE interaction
- ✓ Become downstream user (simpler compliance)

**Disadvantages for You:**
- ❌ No control over registration
- ❌ Dependent on supplier maintaining OR
- ❌ If supplier/OR fails, you cannot import
- ❌ Price increase (unknown amount)

---

### Scenario B: You Register (Current Plan)

**Your Costs:**
| Cost Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| DUIN submission | £1,000 - £2,000 |
| UK REACH registration (2026-2028) | £35,000 - £50,000 |
| Annual compliance | £1,000 - £2,000/year |
| **Total (through 2028)** | **£37,000 - £54,000** |

**Advantages for You:**
- ✓ Full control over registration
- ✓ Not dependent on supplier
- ✓ Can switch suppliers easily (you own registration)
- ✓ Direct relationship with HSE
- ✓ Known costs (not hidden in pricing)

**Disadvantages for You:**
- ❌ Upfront costs (£37,000-£54,000)
- ❌ Registration burden (time, resources)
- ❌ Ongoing compliance obligations
- ❌ Must engage consultant, manage project

## Which is Better: OR or Self-Registration?

### OR is Better If:

✓ **Supplier has many GB customers**
- Costs spread across many companies
- Small price increase per customer
- Supplier willing to invest

✓ **Multiple suppliers available with ORs**
- Not dependent on single supplier
- Can switch between OR-registered suppliers

✓ **You have limited budget**
- Cannot afford £37,000-£54,000
- Prefer operational cost (price increase) over capital cost (registration)

✓ **Single substance, low volume**
- Registration costs high relative to import value
- OR model more economical

---

### Self-Registration is Better If:

✓ **You import high volumes** (your situation: >1000 t/year)
- Registration costs spread over large tonnage
- Per-tonne cost of registration is low

✓ **Supplier unwilling to appoint OR**
- Your current situation
- Supplier has few GB customers
- Not economical for supplier

✓ **You want control and flexibility**
- Can switch suppliers without losing registration
- Direct HSE relationship
- Control over data and compliance

✓ **Long-term business critical**
- Registration is business asset
- Not dependent on supplier's OR remaining active

**For your situation (>1000 t/year, business-critical, supplier hasn't appointed OR):**

**Self-registration is the right choice.**

## Can You Ask Your Supplier to Appoint an OR?

### Yes, You Can Ask

**How to approach your supplier:**

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: UK REACH Compliance - Only Representative Option for Urea

Dear [Supplier Contact],

As you may be aware, UK REACH regulations require registration for substances
imported into Great Britain. We are currently importing Urea (CAS 57-13-6) from
your company at >1000 tonnes per year.

Under current arrangements, we (as the GB importer) are required to complete UK
REACH registration by October 2028, at an estimated cost of £35,000-£50,000.

We would like to explore whether your company has appointed, or would consider
appointing, a GB-based Only Representative (OR) for Urea. This would:

- Transfer UK REACH registration obligations from us to your appointed OR
- Allow us to continue as a downstream user (no registration required)
- Potentially benefit all your GB customers

Questions:
1. Has your company appointed a GB-based Only Representative for Urea?
2. If yes, can you provide OR contact details and UK REACH registration number?
3. If no, would your company consider appointing an OR?
4. What would be the impact on product pricing if OR appointed?

We understand this represents an investment for your company, but it may be
beneficial if you supply multiple GB customers.

Please let us know your position by [date].

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

### Likely Supplier Responses

**Response 1: "We already have an OR"**
- ✓ Great! Request OR details and registration number
- ✓ Verify OR registration with HSE
- ✓ You become downstream user (no registration needed)
- ✓ Cancel your DUIN/registration plans

**Response 2: "We will appoint an OR"**
- ✓ Request timeline for OR appointment and registration
- ✓ Request confirmation when complete
- ✓ Understand any price impacts
- ⚠ Maintain DUIN submission as backup (in case supplier doesn't follow through)

**Response 3: "No, we won't appoint an OR"**
- ✓ Expected response (most common)
- ✓ Proceed with your own registration plan
- ✓ Continue with DUIN and registration pathway

**Response 4: "What's an Only Representative?"**
- ⚠ Supplier doesn't understand UK REACH
- ✓ Send them HSE guidance on ORs
- ✓ Probably proceed with your own registration (supplier unlikely to act)

---

## How to Verify if Your Supplier Has an OR

### Step 1: Ask Your Supplier Directly

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Have you appointed a UK Only Representative for Urea (CAS 57-13-6)?"
2. "If yes, what is the OR company name and contact details?"
3. "What is the UK REACH registration number for Urea?"
4. "Can you provide proof of registration?"

### Step 2: Check Your Current Documentation

**Review your purchase documentation:**
- Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Product invoices
- Technical data sheets

**Look for:**
- Section 1 of SDS: "Only Representative" contact details
- UK REACH registration number (format: starts with number, followed by lots of digits)
- Contact details for a GB-based company representing the manufacturer

### Step 3: Contact HSE (If Needed)

**HSE UK REACH Team:**
- Email: ukreach@hse.gov.uk
- Phone: +44 (0)203 028 3343

**Ask HSE:**
"We are importing Urea (CAS 57-13-6) from [Supplier Name]. Can you confirm if this
supplier has a valid UK REACH registration through an Only Representative?"

**HSE may need:**
- Supplier company name and address
- Substance name and CAS number
- Your company details

---

## Why Your Supplier Likely Does NOT Have an OR

### Evidence from Your Situation

**Indicator 1: You're Eligible for DUIN**
- DUIN is for companies who WERE downstream users under EU REACH (before Brexit)
- DUIN is for companies who ARE NOW importers under UK REACH (after Brexit)
- **If your supplier had appointed an OR, you'd still be a downstream user (not eligible for DUIN)**

**Indicator 2: You're Importing >1000 t/year**
- High volume suggests you're a significant customer
- If supplier had appointed OR, they would have informed you
- You'd have received updated SDS showing OR details

**Indicator 3: March 2019 First Import**
- You were importing from EU supplier during EU REACH era
- You were downstream user then (supplier had EU REACH registration)
- Post-Brexit, supplier did NOT transition to UK REACH via OR route
- You became importer by default

### Conclusion

**Your supplier almost certainly does NOT have a GB-based Only Representative.**

**Therefore:**
- ✓ YOU are the importer under UK REACH
- ✓ YOU must register (or stop importing)
- ✓ DUIN + registration pathway is correct
- ✓ Budget £37,000-£54,000 for full compliance

## What if Your Supplier Appoints an OR After You Register?

### Scenario: You Register, Then Supplier Gets OR

**Timeline:**
1. 2025: You submit DUIN ✓
2. 2026-2028: You prepare registration ✓
3. 2028: You submit registration (£50,000 spent) ✓
4. 2029: Supplier appoints OR and registers Urea ⚠

**What happens:**
- You have a valid UK REACH registration (yours)
- Supplier's OR also has a valid UK REACH registration (theirs)
- **Two separate registrations for same substance**

**Your options:**

**Option A: Maintain Your Registration**
- Continue as registered importer
- Keep paying annual compliance costs
- Maintain control and flexibility
- **Advantage:** Can switch suppliers freely

**Option B: Withdraw Your Registration**
- Transfer to supplier's OR registration
- Become downstream user
- Stop paying compliance costs
- **Disadvantage:** Dependent on supplier's OR

**Financial Impact:**
- ⚠ Your £50,000 investment is "wasted" if you withdraw
- ⚠ But you save future compliance costs (£1,000-£2,000/year)
- ⚠ Supplier may increase prices to cover OR costs

**Likelihood of This Happening:**
- **Low** - If supplier hasn't appointed OR by 2025-2026, unlikely to do so after October 2028
- **Most suppliers either appoint OR early (2021-2023) or don't appoint at all**

**Recommendation:**
- Don't worry about this scenario
- If it happens (unlikely), evaluate Options A vs B at that time
- Your registration is still valuable (control and flexibility)

## Summary: Only Representative Key Points

### What is an OR?
- GB-based company representing non-GB manufacturer
- Fulfills UK REACH obligations on manufacturer's behalf
- Appointed by manufacturer, not by importer

### Who Uses OR?
- Non-GB manufacturers (EU and non-EU treated identically)
- Who want to place substances on GB market
- Without requiring each GB customer to register

### Effect on You (GB Importer)
- **With OR:** You're downstream user (no registration)
- **Without OR:** You're importer (must register)

### EU vs Non-EU Suppliers
- **No difference under UK REACH**
- Both are "non-GB"
- Both can appoint OR with identical process

### Your Situation
- Supplier likely does NOT have OR
- YOU must register as importer
- DUIN + registration pathway is correct
- Budget: £37,000-£54,000 total

### Should You Ask Supplier?
- ✓ Yes, worth asking
- ⚠ Be prepared for "no"
- ✓ Don't delay your registration plans waiting for supplier

### Bottom Line
**For your business (>1000 t/year Urea, business-critical):**

**Self-registration is the right strategy.**
- Gives you control
- Protects business continuity
- Not dependent on supplier
- Known costs

**Proceed with:**
1. DUIN submission (Q4 2025) ✓
2. Consortium/LoA research (Q1 2026) ✓
3. Registration preparation (2026-2028) ✓
4. Registration submission (Q3 2028) ✓

## Document Status

**Created:** November 6, 2025
**Valid Until:** Regulations change
**Next Review:** After supplier inquiry (Q1 2026)

## Disclaimer

This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. The Only Representative route is complex and depends on your supplier's willingness to appoint an OR. Do not delay your own registration preparations waiting for a supplier decision that may never come.

**Recommendation: Proceed with your own UK REACH registration plan (DUIN + full registration) while simultaneously inquiring with your supplier about OR options.**
