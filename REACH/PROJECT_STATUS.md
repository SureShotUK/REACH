# REACH Project - Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-22

## Current State

UK REACH compliance project for Urea imports. **MAJOR UPDATE (22 Dec 2025)**: UK Government announced 3-year extension to registration deadlines. New deadline is 27 October 2029 (was 27 October 2026). However, Alternative Transitional Registration model (ATRm) has NOT been finalized and must be published by October 2027 to provide required 2-year transition period. **No registration preparation work can commence until ATRm is published** - estimated ~22 month waiting period.

## Project Parameters (UPDATED 22 DEC 2025)

- **Substance**: Urea (CAS 57-13-6)
- **Volume**: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest tonnage band)
- **Original Deadline**: 27th October 2026 (now extended)
- **NEW Deadline**: 27th October 2029 (3-year extension - Option 1)
- **ATRm Status**: NOT finalized - "under consideration"
- **ATRm Publication Deadline**: October 2027 (latest, for 2-year transition)
- **Current Phase**: Monitoring phase - no action required until ATRm published
- **Time to Compliance**: 3-4 months registration work (once ATRm is published)

## Active Work Areas

- **Timeline Monitoring**: Passive monitoring for ATRm publication (expected 2026 legislation, must be by Oct 2027)
- **Government Announcement Analysis**: UpdateDec25.md created documenting new timeline and ATRm constraints
- **Consultant Relationships**: Periodic (annual) check-ins with CS Regulatory (low priority until 2027)
- **Documentation**: All major planning documents complete; project now in waiting phase

## Previous Work (Now on Hold Pending ATRm)

- **IUCLID Inquiry Dossier**: Article 26 Inquiry process (may be superseded by ATRm framework)
- **Consultant Research**: 50 UK REACH consultants reviewed and ranked
- **Templates**: Three compliance templates created for downstream user operations

## Blocked/Pending

- ⏳ **Waiting on Government**: ATRm framework publication (expected 2026, must be by Oct 2027)
- ⏳ **All registration work blocked**: Cannot proceed until ATRm requirements are defined
- ⏳ **IUCLID work paused**: Article 26 Inquiry process may be superseded by ATRm
- ⏳ **Consultant engagement paused**: No point engaging until ATRm framework is known
- ⏳ **Cost analysis outdated**: All previous cost estimates may not apply under ATRm model

## Next Priorities

### 2025-2027: Monitoring Phase (Current)
1. **Monitor ATRm publication** - Watch for government legislation (expected 2026)
2. **Review legislation when published** - Understand new requirements
3. **Periodic consultant check-ins** - Annual updates with CS Regulatory (non-urgent)
4. **Continue normal operations** - Import Urea as usual under transitional provisions

### October 2027: ATRm Publication Expected
5. **Immediate consultant engagement** - Contact CS Regulatory for urgent requirements analysis
6. **Gap analysis** - Understand what data/work is needed under ATRm
7. **Cost estimation** - Get updated cost estimates based on actual ATRm

### 2027-2029: Implementation Phase
8. **Execute registration** - Follow ATRm process (3-4 months work)
9. **Target completion** - July 2029 (3 months before Oct 2029 deadline)

## Key Files & Structure

### Core Documentation
- `/REACH/CLAUDE.md` - Project context and instructions
- `/REACH/README.md` - Project overview and action plan
- `/REACH/UpdateDec25.md` - **NEW**: Government announcement analysis and updated timeline (22 Dec 2025)
- `/REACH/IUCLID_Inquiry_Dossier_Guide.md` - Complete IUCLID 6 Cloud step-by-step guide (may be superseded by ATRm)

### Research & Analysis
- `/REACH/research/uk_reach_overview.md` - Comprehensive REACH requirements (⚠️ needs volume correction)
- `/REACH/reports/compliance_assessment_urgent.md` - Compliance status and options (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/costs/cost_estimates.md` - Detailed cost breakdowns (✅ partially corrected, needs review)

### Consultant Research
- `/REACH/Consultants/Ranked_Consultants.md` - 50 consultants reviewed and ranked (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/Consultants_URL.md` - Source URLs for consultant research

### Templates
- `/REACH/templates/supplier_registration_verification.md` - Template for verifying GB supplier registrations
- `/REACH/templates/hse_disclosure_template.md` - Template for HSE contact/disclosure
- `/REACH/templates/downstream_user_compliance_checklist.md` - Ongoing compliance tracking

### Additional Documents
- `/REACH/OnePager.md` - UK REACH registration requirements summary (⚠️ needs review)
- `/REACH/DUIN_Application/` - DUIN eligibility research folder (⚠️ needs review for corrections)
- `/REACH/FARM_LoA.md` - Explanation of LoA and OR concepts
- `/REACH/Only_Representative_Explained.md` - OR detailed explanation

## Critical Success Factors

1. ✅ **Accurate data**: Volume and deadline now corrected across most files
2. ⏳ **Timely action**: With 11 months remaining and 12-24 month registration timeline, must start immediately
3. ⏳ **Pathway selection**: User must choose between GB supplier, own registration, or supplier OR
4. ⏳ **Budget approval**: Costs range from £158k-£170k (GB supplier) to £90k-£420k (own registration) over 5 years
5. ⏳ **Consultant engagement**: If pursuing registration, must engage consultant in next 1-2 months

## Risk Summary

### High Risks
- **Timeline pressure**: 11 months to deadline with 12-24 month typical registration timeline
- **Cost uncertainty**: At 1000+ tonnes, GB supplier premium could be £30k+/year, making own registration more economically viable
- **Data requirements**: 1000+ tonnes requires most comprehensive data package (all Annexes)

### Medium Risks
- **Incomplete corrections**: Some files still need volume/deadline updates
- **Strategic clarity**: Need to re-evaluate which compliance pathway is optimal at this volume

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ Core documentation corrected with accurate parameters
- ⏳ Complete systematic review of all files for remaining errors
- ⏳ Commission detailed cost-benefit analysis for 1000+ tonne scenario
- ⏳ Begin consultant engagement immediately to preserve timeline options

## Notes

### Timeline Updates

**22 December 2025**: Government announced 3-year extension to REACH registration deadlines (Option 1 selected):
- **New deadline**: 27 October 2029 (was 27 October 2026)
- **Complete timeline**: Oct 2029, Oct 2030, Oct 2031 (one-year gaps)
- **ATRm status**: NOT finalized, "under consideration"
- **Critical constraint**: ATRm must be published by October 2027 to provide 2-year transition period
- **Current phase**: Monitoring phase - no registration work can commence until ATRm published
- **Waiting period**: ~22 months (Dec 2025 → Oct 2027)

**Previous corrections (7 November 2025)**: Corrected fundamental project parameters from incorrectly stated volume ">100 tonnes/year" and deadline "October 27, 2025" to correct parameters:
- Volume: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest band, most stringent requirements)
- Deadline: 27th October 2026 (now extended to 2029)

### Strategic Implications

The 3-year extension fundamentally changes project urgency:
- **From**: Urgent compliance crisis (11 months to deadline)
- **To**: Extended monitoring phase (~22 months wait, then 2-year implementation)
- **Impact**: All previous registration work now on hold pending ATRm framework
- **Opportunity**: Government designing cost-reduced ATRm to be less burdensome than EU REACH
- **Risk**: ATRm publication delay would compress available implementation time
