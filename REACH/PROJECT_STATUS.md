# REACH Project - Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-11

## Current State

UK REACH compliance project for multiple substances: **Urea** (existing DUIN, monitoring phase) and **HVO** (NEW project, active planning phase).

**Urea Status**: Extended deadline (27 October 2029), awaiting ATRm framework publication (expected by October 2027). Monitoring phase - no action required until ATRm published.

**HVO Status (NEW - 11 Feb 2026)**: Active compliance planning for new substance import. Company has DUIN for Urea but NOT for HVO (DUIN is per-substance). Small SME, 1-100 tonne band, deadline 27 October 2030. Comprehensive research completed. Recommended pathway: GB supplier (downstream user) for immediate import without registration.

## Blocked/Pending

- ⏳ **Waiting on Government**: ATRm framework publication (expected 2026, must be by Oct 2027)
- ⏳ **All registration work blocked**: Cannot proceed until ATRm requirements are defined
- ⏳ **IUCLID work paused**: Article 26 Inquiry process may be superseded by ATRm
- ⏳ **Consultant engagement paused**: No point engaging until ATRm framework is known
- ⏳ **Cost analysis outdated**: All previous cost estimates may not apply under ATRm model

## Next Priorities

### HVO Project - IMMEDIATE (Feb-Mar 2026)
1. **Contact GB-based HVO suppliers** - Greenergy, Crown Oil, Certas Energy, Nationwide Fuels
   - Request UK REACH registration confirmation (should be UK-01-9638319484-0-XXXX)
   - Request commercial proposals with pricing
   - Verify uses covered by supplier registration
2. **Evaluate supplier proposals** - Compare pricing vs. consortium costs
3. **Decide compliance pathway**:
   - Option A: GB supplier (downstream user) - £0 registration, 6-8 weeks
   - Option B: Join consortium - £3,049-£9,399, 4-6 months
4. **Execute chosen pathway** - Supply agreement OR consortium registration
5. **Begin HVO imports** - After compliance pathway established

### Urea Project - Monitoring Phase (2025-2027)
6. **Monitor ATRm publication** - Watch for government legislation (expected 2026)
7. **Review legislation when published** - Understand new requirements
8. **Periodic consultant check-ins** - Annual updates with CS Regulatory (non-urgent)
9. **Continue normal operations** - Import Urea as usual under transitional provisions

### Urea Project - October 2027: ATRm Publication Expected
10. **Immediate consultant engagement** - Contact CS Regulatory for urgent requirements analysis
11. **Gap analysis** - Understand what data/work is needed under ATRm
12. **Cost estimation** - Get updated cost estimates based on actual ATRm

### Urea Project - 2027-2029: Implementation Phase
13. **Execute registration** - Follow ATRm process (3-4 months work)
14. **Target completion** - July 2029 (3 months before Oct 2029 deadline)

## Critical Success Factors

1. ✅ **Accurate data**: Volume and deadline now corrected across most files
2. ⏳ **Timely action**: With 11 months remaining and 12-24 month registration timeline, must start immediately
3. ⏳ **Pathway selection**: User must choose between GB supplier, own registration, or supplier OR
4. ⏳ **Budget approval**: Costs range from £158k-£170k (GB supplier) to £90k-£420k (own registration) over 5 years
5. ⏳ **Consultant engagement**: If pursuing registration, must engage consultant in next 1-2 months

## Risk Summary

### High Risks
- **Timeline pressure**: 11 months to deadline with 12-24 month typical registration timeline
- **Cost uncertainty**: At 1000+ tonnes, GB supplier premium could be £30k+/year, making own registration more economically viable
- **Data requirements**: 1000+ tonnes requires most comprehensive data package (all Annexes)

### Medium Risks
- **Incomplete corrections**: Some files still need volume/deadline updates
- **Strategic clarity**: Need to re-evaluate which compliance pathway is optimal at this volume

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ Core documentation corrected with accurate parameters
- ⏳ Complete systematic review of all files for remaining errors
- ⏳ Commission detailed cost-benefit analysis for 1000+ tonne scenario
- ⏳ Begin consultant engagement immediately to preserve timeline options

## Notes

### Timeline Updates

**22 December 2025**: Government announced 3-year extension to REACH registration deadlines (Option 1 selected):
- **New deadline**: 27 October 2029 (was 27 October 2026)
- **Complete timeline**: Oct 2029, Oct 2030, Oct 2031 (one-year gaps)
- **ATRm status**: NOT finalized, "under consideration"
- **Critical constraint**: ATRm must be published by October 2027 to provide 2-year transition period
- **Current phase**: Monitoring phase - no registration work can commence until ATRm published
- **Waiting period**: ~22 months (Dec 2025 → Oct 2027)

**Previous corrections (7 November 2025)**: Corrected fundamental project parameters from incorrectly stated volume ">100 tonnes/year" and deadline "October 27, 2025" to correct parameters:
- Volume: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest band, most stringent requirements)
- Deadline: 27th October 2026 (now extended to 2029)

### Strategic Implications

The 3-year extension fundamentally changes project urgency:
- **From**: Urgent compliance crisis (11 months to deadline)
- **To**: Extended monitoring phase (~22 months wait, then 2-year implementation)
- **Impact**: All previous registration work now on hold pending ATRm framework
- **Opportunity**: Government designing cost-reduced ATRm to be less burdensome than EU REACH
- **Risk**: ATRm publication delay would compress available implementation time
