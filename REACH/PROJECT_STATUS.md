# REACH Project - Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-07

## Current State

UK REACH compliance project for Urea imports. **CRITICAL DATA CORRECTED THIS SESSION**: Volume is 1000+ tonnes/year (not >100 t/year) and deadline is 27th October 2026 (not Oct 2025). Project now has accurate baseline data for compliance planning.

## Project Parameters (VERIFIED ACCURATE)

- **Substance**: Urea (CAS 57-13-6)
- **Volume**: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest tonnage band)
- **Deadline**: 27th October 2026 (11 months remaining)
- **Current Status**: No UK REACH registration in place
- **Time to Compliance**: 12-24 months for registration (must start immediately)

## Active Work Areas

- **Documentation**: Core research and compliance assessment complete, now being corrected for accurate volume/deadline
- **Consultant Research**: 50 UK REACH consultants reviewed and ranked in Ranked_Consultants.md
- **Cost Analysis**: Cost estimates provided but being updated for 1000+ tonne volume impacts
- **Templates**: Three compliance templates created for downstream user operations

## Recently Completed

- ✅ Comprehensive UK REACH research and overview
- ✅ Urgent compliance assessment with three pathway options
- ✅ Detailed cost analysis (all options)
- ✅ Consultant ranking (Tier 1-4, 50 consultants assessed)
- ✅ Template documents (supplier verification, HSE disclosure, downstream user checklist)
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected volume from ">100 t/year" to "1000+ tonnes/year"
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected deadline from "Oct 27, 2025" to "27th October 2026"
- ✅ Updated all core documentation with accurate parameters

## Blocked/Pending

- ⏳ Need to complete corrections in remaining files (OnePager.md, uk_reach_overview.md, DUIN folder)
- ⏳ Need to verify all template documents have correct volume/deadline references
- ⏳ Cost-benefit analysis may need revision at 1000+ tonne volume (own registration more viable?)

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete data corrections** - Review all remaining files for volume/deadline errors
2. **Re-evaluate compliance strategy** - At 1000+ tonnes, own registration may be more economically justified vs. GB supplier premium
3. **Refine cost estimates** - Update GB supplier unit cost impact calculations for 1000+ volume
4. **User decisions** - User needs to choose compliance pathway and begin implementation
5. **Timeline planning** - With 11 months to deadline and 12-24 month registration timeline, immediate action required

## Key Files & Structure

### Core Documentation
- `/REACH/CLAUDE.md` - Project context and instructions (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/README.md` - Project overview and action plan (✅ corrected)

### Research & Analysis
- `/REACH/research/uk_reach_overview.md` - Comprehensive REACH requirements (⚠️ needs volume correction)
- `/REACH/reports/compliance_assessment_urgent.md` - Compliance status and options (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/costs/cost_estimates.md` - Detailed cost breakdowns (✅ partially corrected, needs review)

### Consultant Research
- `/REACH/Consultants/Ranked_Consultants.md` - 50 consultants reviewed and ranked (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/Consultants_URL.md` - Source URLs for consultant research

### Templates
- `/REACH/templates/supplier_registration_verification.md` - Template for verifying GB supplier registrations
- `/REACH/templates/hse_disclosure_template.md` - Template for HSE contact/disclosure
- `/REACH/templates/downstream_user_compliance_checklist.md` - Ongoing compliance tracking

### Additional Documents
- `/REACH/OnePager.md` - UK REACH registration requirements summary (⚠️ needs review)
- `/REACH/DUIN_Application/` - DUIN eligibility research folder (⚠️ needs review for corrections)
- `/REACH/FARM_LoA.md` - Explanation of LoA and OR concepts
- `/REACH/Only_Representative_Explained.md` - OR detailed explanation

## Critical Success Factors

1. ✅ **Accurate data**: Volume and deadline now corrected across most files
2. ⏳ **Timely action**: With 11 months remaining and 12-24 month registration timeline, must start immediately
3. ⏳ **Pathway selection**: User must choose between GB supplier, own registration, or supplier OR
4. ⏳ **Budget approval**: Costs range from £158k-£170k (GB supplier) to £90k-£420k (own registration) over 5 years
5. ⏳ **Consultant engagement**: If pursuing registration, must engage consultant in next 1-2 months

## Risk Summary

### High Risks
- **Timeline pressure**: 11 months to deadline with 12-24 month typical registration timeline
- **Cost uncertainty**: At 1000+ tonnes, GB supplier premium could be £30k+/year, making own registration more economically viable
- **Data requirements**: 1000+ tonnes requires most comprehensive data package (all Annexes)

### Medium Risks
- **Incomplete corrections**: Some files still need volume/deadline updates
- **Strategic clarity**: Need to re-evaluate which compliance pathway is optimal at this volume

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ Core documentation corrected with accurate parameters
- ⏳ Complete systematic review of all files for remaining errors
- ⏳ Commission detailed cost-benefit analysis for 1000+ tonne scenario
- ⏳ Begin consultant engagement immediately to preserve timeline options

## Notes

**IMPORTANT**: This session corrected fundamental project parameters. Previous documentation incorrectly stated volume as ">100 tonnes/year" and deadline as "October 27, 2025" (implying deadline had passed). Correct parameters are:
- Volume: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest band, most stringent requirements)
- Deadline: 27th October 2026 (11 months remaining, tight but achievable)

This correction significantly impacts the entire compliance strategy and cost analysis. All future work should use these verified parameters.
