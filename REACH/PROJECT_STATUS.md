# REACH Project - Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-15

## Current State

UK REACH compliance project for Urea imports. User has completed DUIN registration with HSE and is now progressing to Article 26 Inquiry submission phase using IUCLID 6 Cloud. Comprehensive inquiry dossier creation guide completed to address specific technical issues with IUCLID interface.

## Project Parameters (VERIFIED ACCURATE)

- **Substance**: Urea (CAS 57-13-6)
- **Volume**: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest tonnage band)
- **Deadline**: 27th October 2026 (11 months remaining)
- **Current Status**: No UK REACH registration in place
- **Time to Compliance**: 12-24 months for registration (must start immediately)

## Active Work Areas

- **IUCLID Inquiry Dossier**: Creating Article 26 Inquiry in IUCLID 6 Cloud (current phase)
- **Account Setup**: ECHA trial account and Defra account configuration in progress
- **Technical Troubleshooting**: Resolving "Create Dossier" unavailable issue (Legal Entity + Working Context)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive IUCLID step-by-step guide completed
- **Consultant Research**: 50 UK REACH consultants reviewed and ranked (for post-inquiry full registration phase)
- **Templates**: Three compliance templates created for downstream user operations

## Recently Completed

- ✅ **DUIN registration** with REACH UK (prerequisite completed)
- ✅ **IUCLID Inquiry Dossier Guide** - 14-part comprehensive guide (550+ lines)
- ✅ **Technical troubleshooting research** - Identified 3 root causes for "Create Dossier" unavailable
- ✅ **Account requirements clarified** - ECHA trial + Defra accounts for two-system architecture
- ✅ **Minimum IUCLID sections identified** - Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 required for inquiry
- ✅ Comprehensive UK REACH research and overview
- ✅ Urgent compliance assessment with three pathway options
- ✅ Detailed cost analysis (all options)
- ✅ Consultant ranking (Tier 1-4, 50 consultants assessed)
- ✅ Template documents (supplier verification, HSE disclosure, downstream user checklist)
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected volume from ">100 t/year" to "1000+ tonnes/year"
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected deadline from "Oct 27, 2025" to "27th October 2026"

## Blocked/Pending

- ⏳ **User action required**: Fix IUCLID Legal Entity and Working Context settings
- ⏳ **User action required**: Complete IUCLID sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 for Urea
- ⏳ **User action required**: Create and submit inquiry dossier via Comply with UK REACH
- ⏳ **Waiting on HSE**: Inquiry number assignment (after submission)
- ⏳ Need to complete corrections in remaining files (OnePager.md, uk_reach_overview.md, DUIN folder)
- ⏳ Cost-benefit analysis may need revision at 1000+ tonne volume (own registration more viable?)

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete Article 26 Inquiry** - User to follow IUCLID guide and submit inquiry dossier
2. **Receive Inquiry Number** - Access Substance Group for Urea registrants
3. **Data Sharing Negotiations** - Contact other registrants for Letter of Access (LoA) to existing data
4. **Full Registration Planning** - Prepare comprehensive dossier (Annexes VII-XI) for October 2026 deadline
5. **Consultant Engagement** - Engage Tier 1 consultant if pursuing own registration (SGS/Intertek/Ecomundo)
6. **Complete data corrections** - Review all remaining files for volume/deadline errors (lower priority)

## Key Files & Structure

### Core Documentation
- `/REACH/CLAUDE.md` - Project context and instructions (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/README.md` - Project overview and action plan (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/IUCLID_Inquiry_Dossier_Guide.md` - **NEW**: Complete IUCLID 6 Cloud step-by-step guide (14 parts)

### Research & Analysis
- `/REACH/research/uk_reach_overview.md` - Comprehensive REACH requirements (⚠️ needs volume correction)
- `/REACH/reports/compliance_assessment_urgent.md` - Compliance status and options (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/costs/cost_estimates.md` - Detailed cost breakdowns (✅ partially corrected, needs review)

### Consultant Research
- `/REACH/Consultants/Ranked_Consultants.md` - 50 consultants reviewed and ranked (✅ corrected)
- `/REACH/Consultants_URL.md` - Source URLs for consultant research

### Templates
- `/REACH/templates/supplier_registration_verification.md` - Template for verifying GB supplier registrations
- `/REACH/templates/hse_disclosure_template.md` - Template for HSE contact/disclosure
- `/REACH/templates/downstream_user_compliance_checklist.md` - Ongoing compliance tracking

### Additional Documents
- `/REACH/OnePager.md` - UK REACH registration requirements summary (⚠️ needs review)
- `/REACH/DUIN_Application/` - DUIN eligibility research folder (⚠️ needs review for corrections)
- `/REACH/FARM_LoA.md` - Explanation of LoA and OR concepts
- `/REACH/Only_Representative_Explained.md` - OR detailed explanation

## Critical Success Factors

1. ✅ **Accurate data**: Volume and deadline now corrected across most files
2. ⏳ **Timely action**: With 11 months remaining and 12-24 month registration timeline, must start immediately
3. ⏳ **Pathway selection**: User must choose between GB supplier, own registration, or supplier OR
4. ⏳ **Budget approval**: Costs range from £158k-£170k (GB supplier) to £90k-£420k (own registration) over 5 years
5. ⏳ **Consultant engagement**: If pursuing registration, must engage consultant in next 1-2 months

## Risk Summary

### High Risks
- **Timeline pressure**: 11 months to deadline with 12-24 month typical registration timeline
- **Cost uncertainty**: At 1000+ tonnes, GB supplier premium could be £30k+/year, making own registration more economically viable
- **Data requirements**: 1000+ tonnes requires most comprehensive data package (all Annexes)

### Medium Risks
- **Incomplete corrections**: Some files still need volume/deadline updates
- **Strategic clarity**: Need to re-evaluate which compliance pathway is optimal at this volume

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ Core documentation corrected with accurate parameters
- ⏳ Complete systematic review of all files for remaining errors
- ⏳ Commission detailed cost-benefit analysis for 1000+ tonne scenario
- ⏳ Begin consultant engagement immediately to preserve timeline options

## Notes

**IMPORTANT**: This session corrected fundamental project parameters. Previous documentation incorrectly stated volume as ">100 tonnes/year" and deadline as "October 27, 2025" (implying deadline had passed). Correct parameters are:
- Volume: 1000+ tonnes/year (highest band, most stringent requirements)
- Deadline: 27th October 2026 (11 months remaining, tight but achievable)

This correction significantly impacts the entire compliance strategy and cost analysis. All future work should use these verified parameters.
