# REACH Project - Urea Import Compliance Research

**Project Created:** November 5, 2025
**Substance:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6)
**Import Volume:** >100 tonnes per year
**Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT (Urgent action required)

---

## Project Overview

This project contains comprehensive research, compliance assessment, cost analysis, and template documents for achieving UK REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) compliance for Urea imports into Great Britain.

---

## CRITICAL FINDING

**Your business is currently non-compliant with UK REACH regulations.**

You are importing Urea (>100 tonnes/year) without:
- UK REACH registration
- Grandfathered EU REACH registration
- DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)

**This is a criminal offense under UK law with penalties including fines up to £5,000+ and potential imprisonment.**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** STOP importing and read the compliance assessment report.

---

## Project Deliverables

### 1. Research Documentation

**Location:** `/REACH/research/`

#### uk_reach_overview.md
Comprehensive overview of UK REACH requirements including:
- Legal obligations for importers
- Tonnage band requirements for >100 tonnes/year
- Transition arrangements and grandfathering
- Registration deadlines (October 27, 2028)
- Enforcement and penalties
- Urea-specific information
- Data requirements (Annexes VI-IX)

**Key takeaway:** You must either have a UK REACH registration or purchase from a GB supplier who has one.

---

### 2. Compliance Assessment (URGENT)

**Location:** `/REACH/reports/`

#### compliance_assessment_urgent.md
**READ THIS FIRST** - Critical compliance assessment including:
- Your current non-compliant status
- Immediate actions required (this week)
- Legal risks and potential consequences
- Four compliance options analyzed in detail
- **Recommended strategy:** Switch to GB supplier (Option A)
- Implementation timeline and checklist
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Key takeaway:** Stop importing immediately, contact HSE, switch to GB-based supplier with UK REACH registration (fastest, cheapest path to compliance).

---

### 3. Cost Analysis

**Location:** `/REACH/costs/`

#### cost_estimates.md
Detailed financial analysis of all compliance options:

| Option | Timeline | Upfront Cost | 5-Year Total Cost |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Option A: GB Supplier (Recommended)** | 2-8 weeks | £4k-£10k | £30k-£50k |
| Option B: Own Registration | 12-24 months | £65k-£345k | £90k-£420k |
| Option C: Supplier OR | 12-24 months | Variable | Variable |
| Non-compliance | N/A | £25k-£100k+ | Potentially unlimited |

**Key takeaway:** Option A (GB supplier) is fastest and most cost-effective for immediate compliance.

---

### 4. Template Documents

**Location:** `/REACH/templates/`

Three comprehensive templates for ongoing compliance management:

#### supplier_registration_verification.md
Template for verifying and documenting that your GB supplier has valid UK REACH registration:
- Supplier information capture
- Registration verification checklist
- Use coverage assessment
- Risk management measures
- Annual review tracking
- Red flags to watch for

**Use this:** When qualifying any new Urea supplier.

#### hse_disclosure_template.md
Template for contacting HSE to disclose non-compliance and request guidance:
- Two template approaches (full disclosure vs. information request)
- Preparation checklist
- Legal review requirements
- Follow-up protocol
- HSE contact information

**IMPORTANT:** Have legal counsel review before sending.

**Use this:** After engaging legal counsel, when ready to contact HSE.

#### downstream_user_compliance_checklist.md
Ongoing compliance checklist for operating as a downstream user:
- Initial setup requirements
- Annual review checklist
- Ongoing compliance activities
- Incident reporting procedures
- Document retention requirements
- Management review template
- Compliance metrics tracking

**Use this:** Once you've switched to a GB supplier and need to maintain ongoing compliance.

## Critical Success Factors

For successful compliance, you must:

1. **Act immediately** - Every day of continued illegal importing increases liability
2. **Engage professionals** - Legal counsel and REACH consultant are essential
3. **Stop importing** - Until compliance established
4. **Choose pragmatic path** - Option A (GB supplier) is fastest and cheapest
5. **Maintain documentation** - 10-year retention requirement
6. **Annual reviews** - Verify supplier registration remains valid
7. **Stay informed** - Monitor regulatory changes

---

## Risk Summary

### High Risks (Immediate)

- **Criminal liability** - Current imports are illegal
- **Fines and penalties** - £5,000+ (magistrates) to much higher (crown court)

- **Business disruption** - Forced cessation, seized goods
- **Personal liability** - Directors and officers can be personally liable

### Medium Risks (Ongoing)

- **Supplier non-compliance** - GB supplier's registration lapses
- **Supply chain disruption** - Dependency on GB suppliers
- **Price increases** - GB suppliers may cost more than direct import
- **Regulatory changes** - UK REACH requirements may change

### Risk Mitigation

- Switch to GB supplier immediately (eliminates high risks)
