# UK REACH Update - December 2025

**Date:** 22nd December 2025
**Status:** Government Consultation Response Published

## Executive Summary

The UK Government has announced its decision on extending UK REACH transitional registration submission deadlines following the 2025 consultation. The government has selected **Option 1** as their preferred approach, extending the first deadline by 3 years to **27 October 2029**.

**CRITICAL:** The Alternative Transitional Registration model (ATRm) framework has **NOT** been finalized. Further work on registration preparation is not advisable until the ATRm requirements are published.

**ATRm PUBLICATION DEADLINE:** Industry should receive a **2-year transition period** once the ATRm is published. With the new deadline of 27 October 2029, this means the ATRm **must be published by October 2027 at the latest**. Until then, no meaningful registration preparation work can commence.

## New Registration Timeline

### Updated Deadlines (Option 1 - Government's Choice)

For substances 1000+ tonnes/year (including Urea):
- **Original deadline:** 27 October 2026
- **New deadline:** 27 October 2029

**Complete timeline for all tonnage bands:**
- **27 October 2029** - High volume substances (1000+ tpa), carcinogens/mutagens/reproductive toxins (≥1 tpa), very toxic to aquatic life (≥100 tpa)
- **27 October 2030** - Medium volume substances (100-1000 tpa)
- **27 October 2031** - Lower volume substances (1-100 tpa)

This represents a **3-year extension** with **one-year gaps** between tonnage bands.

## Consultant Discussions

Prior to this announcement, discussions were held with three UK REACH consultants regarding registration strategy. All three independently advised **waiting for the government's decision** on the consultation before proceeding with any registration work.

### Consultants Contacted

**1. Craig Deegan - CS Regulatory** (Preferred consultant)
- Specialist regulatory consulting firm
- Advised waiting for consultation outcome and ATRm framework publication

**2. Janet Greenwood - TT Environmental** (Second preference)
- Environmental compliance consultancy
- Advised waiting for consultation outcome and ATRm framework publication

**3. Ian Guest - Valpak** (Third preference)
- Note: Valpak subcontracts REACH consulting work to CS Regulatory
- Advised waiting for consultation outcome and ATRm framework publication

### Consultant Selection

Preference order: CS Regulatory → TT Environmental → Valpak

**Rationale:** CS Regulatory is the direct provider of specialist REACH consulting services. Valpak uses CS Regulatory for their REACH work, making direct engagement with CS Regulatory more efficient.

## The Alternative Transitional Registration Model (ATRm)

### Current Status: UNDEFINED

The government consultation document states:

> "The 2024 ATRm consultation sought views on a proposed ATRm model. Whilst this remains under consideration, our expectation is that the final transitional registration requirements will not exceed those outlined in the consultation."

### Key Points

1. **ATRm is NOT finalized** - The framework remains "under consideration"
2. **No published requirements** - Specific data requirements and registration process details are not yet available
3. **Uncertainty remains** - Companies cannot accurately plan or cost registration work
4. **Legislation pending** - New regulations will be brought forward in 2026
5. **2-year transition period expected** - Industry should receive adequate time to adapt to new requirements

### ATRm Publication Deadline Constraint

**Critical timing constraint identified:**

Given the new registration deadline of **27 October 2029** and the expectation that industry should receive a **2-year transition period** to implement the new ATRm requirements, the following timeline constraint applies:

- **Latest ATRm publication date:** October 2027
- **Minimum transition period:** 2 years (October 2027 → October 2029)
- **Industry readiness:** Cannot commence meaningful work until ATRm is published

**Implications:**

1. **Waiting period: Up to ~22 months** - From December 2025 to October 2027, no substantive registration work can begin
2. **Government timeline pressure** - Government must finalize and publish ATRm by October 2027 to provide industry the necessary 2-year adaptation period
3. **No action required until late 2027** - Businesses cannot make informed decisions or preparations until ATRm framework is available
4. **Compressed timeline risk** - If ATRm is published later than October 2027, industry will have less than 2 years to comply

**This means the earliest realistic start date for registration preparation work is October 2027.**

### Why Further Work is NOT Advisable Yet

- **Unknown requirements:** The ATRm may significantly differ from full UK REACH registration requirements
- **Potential cost reduction:** ATRm is specifically designed to reduce costs compared to EU REACH
- **Wasted effort risk:** Work done now may need to be redone once ATRm is published
- **Resource inefficiency:** Consultant time and money spent now may not align with final requirements
- **Timeline adequate:** With the new October 2029 deadline, there is time to wait for clarity

**Recommendation:** **WAIT** for ATRm framework publication before commencing registration preparation work.

## Revised Timeline for Registration Process

Once the ATRm framework is published, the following timeline should be anticipated:

### Preparation Phase: **2 months**
- Review ATRm requirements
- Engage consultant (CS Regulatory preferred)
- Gather necessary data and information
- Prepare registration dossier
- Internal review and quality checks

### Submission and Approval Phase: **2 weeks**
- Submit dossier to HSE via Comply with UK REACH portal
- HSE processing and initial review
- Registration granted (if dossier is complete and compliant)

### **CRITICAL TIMING CONSTRAINT**

The 2-week approval timeline assumes a **complete and error-free submission**.

**If the dossier contains errors or missing information:**
- The 2-week timeline does NOT allow for corrections and resubmission
- Additional time will be required, potentially delaying legal compliance
- This could result in inability to legally import until registration is corrected

**Recommendation:** Allow **3-4 months total** (not 2.25 months) to provide buffer for:
- Unexpected data gaps
- Consultant availability constraints
- HSE queries or clarification requests
- Potential revisions and resubmission

## Government's Rationale for Option 1

Despite 70% of consultation respondents preferring Option 2 (2½ year extension with 2-year gaps), the government selected Option 1 for the following reasons:

1. **ATRm finalization time:** Provides sufficient time to finalize and legislate the ATRm before the first deadline
2. **Reduced information burden:** ATRm will significantly reduce data requirements compared to EU REACH
3. **Proportionality:** Shorter one-year intervals are justified because ATRm reduces the data burden
4. **Earlier data availability:** Gets safety information to regulators sooner than Option 2
5. **Protection maintained:** Allows prioritization of most hazardous substances at earliest deadline

## Next Steps

### 2025-2027: Monitoring Phase (No Action Required)

Given the 2-year transition period requirement, **no substantive registration work can commence until the ATRm is published**, which must occur by October 2027 at the latest.

**Monitoring activities only:**
1. **Watch for ATRm publication** - Government must publish by October 2027
2. **Review legislation** - When brought forward (expected 2026)
3. **Track HSE guidance** - Watch for technical guidance and IUCLID templates
4. **Periodic consultant check-ins** - Annual updates with CS Regulatory (not urgent)

### October 2027: ATRm Publication Expected

**If ATRm is published by October 2027 (as required for 2-year transition):**

1. **Immediate consultant engagement** - Contact CS Regulatory for urgent assessment
2. **Requirements analysis** - Understand ATRm data and process requirements
3. **Gap analysis** - Identify what data we have vs. what ATRm requires
4. **Cost estimation** - Get firm cost estimates based on actual ATRm requirements
5. **Timeline planning** - Develop detailed project plan for registration

### 2027-2029: Implementation Phase (2 years)

**Revised Deadline Management:**

- **ATRm publication:** October 2027 (latest date for 2-year transition)
- **Project start:** October 2027 (upon ATRm publication)
- **Target completion:** 27 July 2029 (3 months before deadline)
- **Registration deadline:** 27 October 2029
- **Available time:** 24 months (if ATRm published on time)
- **Required time:** 3-4 months (dossier preparation + submission)
- **Buffer available:** ~20 months (adequate contingency)

**Note:** If ATRm is published earlier than October 2027, work can commence earlier. However, government has indicated legislation in 2026, so realistically work may not begin until mid-to-late 2027 at earliest.

## Impact on Business Operations

### Positive Developments
- **Time pressure relieved:** 3-year extension provides breathing room
- **Cost uncertainty reduced:** ATRm expected to cost less than full UK REACH registration
- **Legal compliance maintained:** Can continue importing during transitional period
- **Extended planning horizon:** ~22 months before any action is required (December 2025 → October 2027)
- **No immediate resource commitment:** No consultant fees or internal resources needed until late 2027
- **Adequate implementation time:** 2-year transition period once ATRm is published

### Outstanding Uncertainties
- **ATRm cost:** Cannot estimate until requirements are published
- **Data requirements:** Unknown if existing Urea consortium data will be sufficient
- **Consultant fees:** Will depend on complexity of ATRm vs. full registration
- **HSE processing:** Actual approval times may vary from 2-week estimate
- **ATRm publication timing:** Government must publish by October 2027, but exact date unknown

### Operational Planning

**Current Status (December 2025 - October 2027):**
- Continue importing Urea as normal under transitional provisions
- No REACH registration costs during this period
- No disruption to supply chain
- Maintain awareness of ATRm developments (low-effort monitoring)

**Preparation Phase (October 2027 onwards):**
- Activate registration project once ATRm is published
- Engage consultant and allocate internal resources
- Begin incurring registration-related costs
- Plan for completion well ahead of October 2029 deadline
