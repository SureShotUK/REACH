---

## 2. Classification and Labeling Requirements

### 2.1 UK CLP Classification

HVO is classified under UK CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging) Regulation as:

**Hazard Classes:**
- **Flammable Liquid Category 3** - H226: Flammable liquid and vapour
- **Aspiration Toxicity Category 1** - H304: May be fatal if swallowed and enters airways

**Additional Statement:**
- **EUH066:** Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking

### 2.2 Labeling Requirements

**Signal Word:** Danger

**Hazard Pictograms:**
- GHS02 (Flame) - for flammable liquids
- GHS08 (Health hazard) - for aspiration toxicity

**Precautionary Statements:**
- **P301+P310:** IF SWALLOWED: Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor
- **P331:** Do NOT induce vomiting
- **P405:** Store locked up

### 2.3 Safety Data Sheet (SDS)

Suppliers must provide Safety Data Sheets complying with:
- UK REACH Annex II requirements
- 16-section format
- Must reference UK REACH registration number
- Updated for any changes in classification or exposure scenarios

---

## 3. Importer Obligations Under UK REACH

### 3.1 Who is an Importer?

Under UK REACH, an **importer** is defined as:
> "Someone who brings chemical substances into GB (Great Britain: England, Scotland, Wales) from either the EU/EEA or NI (Northern Ireland) or from the rest of the world"

**Critical distinction post-Brexit:**
- UK businesses that previously purchased from EU suppliers as "downstream users" under EU REACH are now classified as **importers** under UK REACH
- This creates new registration obligations that didn't exist pre-Brexit

### 3.2 Registration Threshold

**Importers must register substances at:**
- **≥1 tonne per year** per legal entity

**Example:** If your company imports 100 tonnes of HVO per year from an EU supplier, you are an importer requiring UK REACH compliance.

### 3.3 Core Importer Obligations

Importers must ensure:

1. **Valid UK REACH Registration Exists** for the substance at the imported tonnage band
2. **Supply Chain Communication** - Pass Safety Data Sheets and exposure scenarios downstream
3. **Record Keeping** - Maintain records of:
   - Substance identity
   - Imported quantities
   - Suppliers and customers
   - Safety information
4. **Compliance with Restrictions** - Ensure use complies with any UK REACH restrictions (none currently for HVO)

### 3.4 Downstream User vs Importer

**You are a Downstream User if:**
- Your GB supplier manufactures or imports the substance and holds a UK REACH registration
- You purchase from a GB-based distributor or formulator
- You use the substance according to identified uses in your supplier's registration

**You are an Importer if:**
- You directly import from non-GB suppliers (EU, NI, rest of world)
- You bring the substance into GB yourself

**Implication:** Downstream users do NOT need to register substances, but importers DO.

---

## 4. Compliance Pathways for HVO Importers

### 4.1 Option 1: Downstream User Status

**How it works:**
- Purchase HVO from a GB-based supplier who holds or references a valid UK REACH registration
- Rely on their registration covering your use

**Requirements:**
- Use substance in accordance with supplier's identified uses and exposure scenarios
- Implement recommended risk management measures
- Notify supplier if your use is "outside" their identified uses

**Costs:**
- No registration costs
- May be reflected in product pricing by supplier

**Advantages:**
- Simplest approach
- No direct REACH obligations
- Supplier handles compliance

**Disadvantages:**
- Dependent on supplier maintaining registration
- Limited to supplier's identified uses
- May reduce supplier flexibility if switching sources

**Suitability for HVO:** HIGH - Most fuel distributors will maintain registrations

### 4.2 Option 2: Join Existing Consortium/Registration

**How it works:**
- Contact lead registrant or consortium for HVO (EC 700-571-2)
- Purchase Letter of Access (LoA) to reference existing registration data
- Submit your own member registration dossier

**Requirements:**
1. **Identify Lead Registrant/Consortium**
   - Search UK HSE Comply with UK REACH service
   - Contact known HVO producers (Neste, Greenergy, etc.)
   - Join existing SIEF (Substance Information Exchange Forum)

2. **Negotiate Letter of Access**
   - Agree fair, transparent, non-discriminatory costs
   - Obtain rights to reference joint registration data

3. **Prepare Member Dossier**
   - Use IUCLID 6 Cloud software (free from ECHA)
   - Include company-specific information:
     - Legal entity details
     - Tonnage manufactured/imported
     - Uses and exposure scenarios
     - Classification and labeling (if different)
   - Reference lead dossier for intrinsic properties data

4. **Submit via Comply with UK REACH**
   - Create account at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-comply-with-reach-chemical-regulations" target="_blank">GOV.UK Comply with UK REACH</a>
   - Submit member dossier
   - Pay HSE registration fee

**Costs:**
- **Letter of Access:** €2,500 - €45,000 (substance and tonnage dependent)
  - Typical range: €5,000 - €15,000
  - Petrochemicals often: €10,000
  - High-tonnage substances may cost more
- **HSE Registration Fee:** £2,222 (standard) or reduced SME rates:
  - Medium enterprise: £740
  - Small enterprise: £399
  - Micro enterprise: £57
- **Consultant Support (optional):** £5,000 - £20,000+ depending on complexity
- **Analytical Testing (identity confirmation):** ~€800 for HPLC, MS, IR, NMR

**Total Estimated Cost:** £8,000 - £50,000+ (including Letter of Access, fees, consultant)

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost than independent registration (no vertebrate testing costs)
- Access to established safety data
- Industry-recognized approach
- Maintain flexibility in sourcing

**Disadvantages:**
- Upfront costs required
- Must negotiate with existing registrants
- Annual consortium fees may apply
- Some administrative burden

**Suitability for HVO:** VERY HIGH - Likely path for importers >1 tonne/year

### 4.3 Option 3: Only Representative Arrangement

**How it works:**
- Non-GB supplier appoints a GB-based Only Representative (OR)
- OR takes on all importer obligations on behalf of non-GB supplier
- Importer becomes a "downstream user" in UK regulatory terms

**Requirements:**
- Non-GB supplier must agree to appoint OR
- OR must be:
  - Legally established in Great Britain
  - Knowledgeable about substance handling and safety
  - Mutually agreed with supplier
  - Willing to take full legal responsibility

**Costs:**
- OR services: Typically £5,000 - £30,000+ per substance per year
- Registration costs borne by OR/supplier
- May be passed through in product pricing

**Advantages:**
- No direct importer registration burden
- Supplier maintains customer relationships
- Multiple importers from same supplier benefit
- Suitable for long-term supplier relationships

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires supplier cooperation (may be unwilling)
- OR costs significant
- Limited control over registration
- Dependency on supplier's OR arrangement

**Suitability for HVO:** MODERATE - Depends on supplier willingness (many EU HVO producers may already have UK OR arrangements)

### 4.4 Option 4: Independent Full Registration

**How it works:**
- Complete entirely independent UK REACH registration for HVO
- Generate or purchase all required data independently
- Submit as sole registrant or lead registrant

**Requirements:**
- Full REACH information requirements for tonnage band:
  - 1-10 tonnes: Basic data set
  - 10-100 tonnes: Additional testing
  - 100-1000 tonnes: Extended data
  - 1000+ tonnes: Comprehensive data including Chemical Safety Report

**Costs:**
- **Data generation:** £100,000 - £500,000+ (if conducting new studies)
  - Note: For established substances like HVO, vertebrate testing should be avoided by data sharing
- **Consultant support:** £20,000 - £100,000+
- **HSE registration fee:** £2,222 (standard)
- **Chemical Safety Report (1000+ tonnes):** £10,000 - £50,000

**Total Estimated Cost:** £130,000 - £650,000+

**Advantages:**
- Complete control over registration
- Own data ownership
- No dependency on consortium

**Disadvantages:**
- Extremely expensive
- Time-consuming (12-24+ months)
- Legally required to seek data sharing first (cannot duplicate vertebrate studies)
- Commercially unjustifiable for most importers

**Suitability for HVO:** VERY LOW - Not recommended; HVO already registered

## 5. Deadlines and Transitional Provisions

### 5.1 Key UK REACH Deadlines

**Transitional Registration Deadlines** (for substances with DUIN submitted):

| Tonnage Band / Hazard | Full Registration Deadline |
|---|---|
| ≥1000 tonnes/year | **27 October 2026** |
| ≥100 tonnes/year OR CMR/H400/H410 ≥1 tonne/year | 27 October 2028 |
| 1-100 tonnes/year | 27 October 2030 |

**Critical:** The 27 October 2026 deadline is **less than 9 months away** for high-tonnage substances.

### 5.2 Grandfathering from EU REACH

**What is Grandfathering?**
- Allows GB-based companies with existing EU REACH registrations (held before Brexit) to transition to UK REACH
- Requires submission through Comply with UK REACH service
- No HSE registration fee for grandfathering
- Must provide full information requirements by relevant deadline (2026/2028/2030)

**Who can use Grandfathering?**
- GB-based legal entities who held EU REACH registrations as of 31 December 2020
- Must have been the registrant (not just importer covered by a supplier's registration)

**Implication for HVO:**
- If you were NOT an EU REACH registrant before Brexit, grandfathering does NOT apply
- Former downstream users under EU REACH must now register as importers under UK REACH

### 5.3 DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)

**What is DUIN?**
- Notification system for businesses that were downstream users or covered by Only Representative under EU REACH
- Provided transitional period to obtain UK REACH compliance

**DUIN Deadline:** 27 October 2021 (300 days after 1 January 2021)

**Current Status (February 2026):**
- Official DUIN window closed in 2021
- However, HSE guidance states: "If you did not notify HSE and wish to continue to import EU REACH registered substances into Great Britain at or above one tonne per year, you can still submit a notification, if eligible to do so, as soon as possible"
- Late DUIN submission may still provide transitional registration benefits

**Action if DUIN not submitted:**
- Contact HSE immediately to discuss eligibility for late submission
- If ineligible, full registration required to continue importing

### 5.4 Urgency for HVO Importers

**If importing ≥1000 tonnes/year HVO:**
- **Deadline: 27 October 2026** (8 months, 16 days from research date)
- Must complete one of:
  - Downstream user arrangement (switch to GB supplier)
  - Join consortium and submit member registration
  - Arrange Only Representative with supplier
  - Complete independent registration (not recommended)

**Timeline Considerations:**
- Letter of Access negotiations: 1-3 months
- IUCLID dossier preparation: 2-4 months
- HSE submission and approval: 1-3 months
- **Recommended action: Start immediately** to meet October 2026 deadline

## 6. Renewable Fuels Regulatory Framework

### 6.1 Intersection of REACH and Fuel Regulations

HVO is subject to TWO separate regulatory frameworks in the UK:

#### UK REACH (Chemical Safety)
- Focuses on hazards, safe use, supply chain communication
- Registration requirements for substances ≥1 tonne/year
- Administered by HSE

#### Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) & Fuel Quality Standards
- Focuses on sustainability, greenhouse gas savings, fuel quality
- Administered by Department for Transport (DfT)
- Different compliance system

**Important:** REACH registration is SEPARATE from RTFO compliance. Both are required.

### 6.2 Fuel Quality Standards for HVO

**EN 15940 Standard:**
- European standard for paraffinic diesel fuels from synthesis or hydrotreatment
- HVO must meet EN 15940 to be legally marketed as drop-in diesel replacement
- Covers chemical, physical, and environmental properties

**Fuel Quality Directive 2009/30/EC Annex II:**
- EU directive retained in UK law post-Brexit
- Sets specifications for diesel fuels
- HVO meeting EN 15940 complies with UK fuel quality requirements

### 6.3 Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO)

**Overview:**
- UK policy requiring fuel suppliers to include minimum percentage of renewable transport fuels
- Obligation applies once total supply exceeds 450,000 litres per year
- Suppliers earn Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) for eligible fuel

**Sustainability Certification:**
HVO must be certified under recognized sustainability schemes, including:

1. **ISCC EU (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification)**
   - Most widely used: 92.4% of UK renewable fuel in 2023 certified by ISCC
   - Verifies compliance with EU RED (Renewable Energy Directive) criteria
   - Recognized by UK Department for Transport

2. **RSB (Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials)**
   - UK RTFO Fuel Certification scheme
   - Verifies sustainable sourcing and production

3. **Zemo RFAS (Renewable Fuels Assurance Scheme)**
   - UK-specific voluntary scheme
   - Helps fleet operators verify sustainable fuel volumes
   - Verifies volumes certified under EC RED schemes like ISCC-EU

**REACH Interaction:**
- RTFO certification does NOT replace REACH registration
- Suppliers must hold both REACH registration AND sustainability certification
- Safety Data Sheets must be provided regardless of RTFO status

### 6.4 REACH Exemptions for Petroleum Products

**Mineral Fuels:**
- Crude oil, natural gas, coal, and coke have specific exemptions from certain REACH provisions
- These exemptions do NOT apply to HVO (HVO is not a mineral fuel)

**HVO Treatment:**
- HVO is a chemically defined substance (renewable hydrocarbons)
- Full REACH obligations apply
- No fuel-related exemptions from registration requirements

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Missing October 2026 deadline** | MODERATE-HIGH | CRITICAL | Start process immediately; engage consultant; consider switching to GB supplier as backup |
| **Consortium LoA costs exceed budget** | MODERATE | MODERATE | Budget £15,000-£40,000; explore SME fee reductions; consider supplier switching |
| **Lead registrant unresponsive** | LOW-MODERATE | MODERATE | Identify multiple potential consortia; engage REACH consultant to leverage industry contacts |
| **Dossier rejected for incompleteness** | LOW | MODERATE | Use experienced consultant; allow 2-3 months for HSE review before deadline |
| **DUIN not submitted and ineligible** | LOW | HIGH | Contact HSE immediately to discuss late submission; if ineligible, expedite registration |

### 10.2 Supply Chain Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-compliance blocks imports** | LOW (if action taken) | CRITICAL | Prioritize compliance; have contingency GB suppliers identified |
| **Supplier changes/exits market** | LOW | MODERATE | Own registration provides independence; maintain relationships with multiple suppliers |
| **HVO availability issues** | LOW | MODERATE | HVO market growing; multiple global producers; diverse supply base |
| **Price increases due to compliance costs** | MODERATE-HIGH | LOW-MODERATE | Factor compliance costs into business model; may affect all market participants equally |

### 10.3 Business Continuity

**Scenario: Unable to complete registration by deadline**

**Contingency Options:**
1. **Switch to GB-based supplier** (downstream user status)
   - Action now: Identify and vet potential suppliers
   - Pre-negotiate supply agreements
   - May involve higher per-tonne costs but eliminates registration burden

2. **Temporary tonnage reduction** (below 1 tonne/year)
   - Not practical for 1000+ tonne/year operations
   - Consider only as absolute last resort

3. **Supplier-appointed Only Representative**
   - Negotiate with current supplier to appoint UK-based OR
   - May take 6-12 months to arrange
   - Start discussions immediately

**Recommended Approach:**
- Primary path: Join consortium (start now)
- Backup path: Identify GB suppliers accepting new customers
- Monitor progress monthly against milestones

## 11. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 11.1 Key Conclusions

1. **HVO is Already Registered Under UK REACH**
   - Registration number UK-01-9638319484-0-0004 confirmed
   - Multiple registrants likely exist
   - Consortium or joint registration arrangements expected

2. **Importers Have Clear Obligations**
   - UK businesses importing HVO from non-GB sources must hold or reference a valid UK REACH registration
   - The ≥1 tonne/year threshold applies per legal entity
   - Post-Brexit, many former "downstream users" are now "importers"

3. **October 2026 Deadline is Urgent**
   - Less than 9 months remain for 1000+ tonnes/year substances
   - Registration process takes 4-6 months minimum
   - Immediate action required

4. **Multiple Compliance Pathways Exist**
   - Downstream user status (via GB supplier): Simplest, £0 cost
   - Joining consortium: Recommended for importers, £15,000-£40,000
   - Only Representative: Supplier-dependent, £25,000-£150,000 over 5 years
   - Independent registration: Not recommended, £130,000-£650,000+

5. **Costs are Manageable for High-Volume Importers**
   - £15,000-£40,000 upfront for consortium membership
   - Amortized over 1000+ tonnes/year: £15-£40 per tonne over 5 years
   - SME fee reductions significantly lower costs for smaller companies

### 11.2 Primary Recommendation

**For UK businesses importing 1000+ tonnes/year HVO:**

**Join the existing UK REACH consortium for renewable hydrocarbons (diesel type fraction)**

**Rationale:**
- Balances cost, control, and compliance
- Leverages existing registration data
- Maintains supply chain flexibility
- Industry-standard approach
- Meets legal obligations

**Action Steps:**
1. **Week 1:** Assess current status, tonnage, and DUIN submission history
2. **Week 2-4:** Engage REACH consultant and identify lead registrant/consortium
3. **Month 2-3:** Negotiate Letter of Access and prepare IUCLID dossier
4. **Month 4-6:** Submit registration dossier, pay fees, obtain UK REACH registration number
5. **By October 2026:** Achieve full compliance before deadline

### 11.3 Alternative Recommendation for Lower-Risk Tolerance

**Switch to GB-based HVO supplier (become downstream user)**

**Rationale:**
- Zero direct compliance burden
- No upfront costs
- Fastest path to compliance (can implement within 30-60 days)
- Supplier manages all REACH obligations

**Trade-offs:**
- Potential price premium
- Reduced supply chain flexibility
- Dependency on supplier maintaining registration

**Suitability:**
- Companies with lower risk tolerance
- Smaller importers (<100 tonnes/year)
- Businesses prioritizing simplicity over cost

### 11.4 Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Confirm import volumes and DUIN status
2. Calculate registration deadline
3. Review budget for compliance pathway
4. Decide: consortium membership or supplier switch

**Short-term (This Month):**
1. If consortium: Contact lead registrant, engage consultant
2. If supplier switch: Request proposals from GB-based suppliers
3. Brief senior management on timeline and costs

**Medium-term (Months 2-6):**
1. Execute chosen compliance pathway
2. Monitor progress against milestones
3. Prepare for registration submission
4. Maintain records and documentation
