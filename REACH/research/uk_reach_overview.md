# UK REACH Overview - Urea Imports

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025
**Substance:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6, EC 200-315-5)
**Import Volume:** >100 tonnes per year

---

## Executive Summary

UK REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is a post-Brexit UK regulation that replaced EU REACH for Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales). Any business importing 1 tonne or more per year of a chemical substance into GB must ensure it is registered under UK REACH.

**CRITICAL:** Importing without proper UK REACH compliance is a **criminal offense** with penalties up to £5,000 and 3 months imprisonment (magistrates court) or higher penalties in Crown Court.

---

## Key Legal Requirements

### Registration Obligation

- **Article 5 ("No data, no market")**: Any GB-based legal entity importing a substance into Great Britain at or above 1 tonne per year must submit a registration to HSE
- Importers from EU/EEA are now treated as "importers" under UK REACH (not downstream users as under EU REACH)
- Non-GB based companies must appoint a GB-based Only Representative (OR) to handle registration

### Tonnage Bands

UK REACH uses tonnage bands that determine data requirements and deadlines:
- 1-10 tonnes/year
- 10-100 tonnes/year
- 100-1000 tonnes/year
- **1000+ tonnes/year** ← Our category

### Data Requirements for 100+ Tonnes/Year

For substances at 100 tonnes or more per year, you need data specified in **Annexes VI, VII, VIII and IX**:
- Annex VI: General information on substance properties
- Annex VII: Base set of toxicological and ecotoxicological data (required for 1+ t/yr)
- Annex VIII: Additional toxicological and ecotoxicological data (required for 10+ t/yr)
- Annex IX: Extended toxicological and ecotoxicological data (required for 100+ t/yr)

Requirements are cumulative - the 100+ tonne band includes all requirements from lower bands plus additional testing.

## Transition Arrangements Post-Brexit

### Grandfathering (Missed Deadline)

Companies that held EU REACH registrations as GB-based legal entities before Brexit could transfer them to UK REACH through "grandfathering":
- **Initial notification deadline: April 30, 2021** (MISSED)
- No registration fee for grandfathering
- Still required to meet full UK REACH data requirements by final deadlines

### DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)

GB-based companies that were downstream users under EU REACH (importing from EU suppliers with EU REACH registrations) could submit a DUIN to defer registration:
- This converted their status from "downstream user" to "importer"
- Allows deferred registration deadlines based on tonnage band
- **If submitted, registration not required until October 27, 2026 for 1000+ tonnes/year**

---

## Registration Deadlines

### Full Registration Deadlines (Extended in 2023)

Original deadlines were extended by 3 years in July 2023:

| Tonnage Band | Original Deadline | Extended Deadline |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1000+ t/yr OR CMR/high hazard | Oct 27, 2023 | **Oct 27, 2026** |
| 100-1000 t/yr | Oct 27, 2025 | Oct 27, 2028 |
| 1-100 t/yr | Oct 27, 2027 | Oct 27, 2030 |

**Our deadline: October 27, 2026** (if DUIN was submitted, or for new registrations)

## Current Compliance Status - CRITICAL QUESTIONS

Since you are currently importing >1000 tonnes/year of Urea, we MUST be in one of these situations:

### Option 1: Grandfathered Registration
- You (or your supplier) held an EU REACH registration as a GB entity before Brexit
- You submitted grandfathering notification to HSE by April 30, 2021
- You have until Oct 27, 2028 to complete full registration

### Option 2: DUIN Submitted
- You were previously importing from EU suppliers with EU REACH registrations
- You submitted a DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification) to HSE
- You have until Oct 27, 2028 to complete full registration

### Option 3: Full UK REACH Registration
- You have already completed a full UK REACH registration for Urea
- You are compliant

### Option 4: Non-Compliant (URGENT)
- You are importing without any of the above
- **This is a criminal offense under UK law**
- You cannot legally continue importing
- Enforcement action possible

## Registration Costs (Updated April 1, 2025)

### HSE Registration Fees (New Flat Fee Structure)

Effective April 1, 2025, the UK introduced significantly reduced flat fees:

| Company Size | Registration Fee (All Tonnage Bands ≥10 t/yr) |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Large (Standard)** | **£2,222** |
| Medium Enterprise | £740 |
| Small Enterprise | £399 |
| Micro Enterprise | £57 |

**Note:** This is a significant reduction from previous fees (previous fee for 100-1000 t/yr was £8,185)

### Additional Costs Beyond HSE Fees

The HSE registration fee is only one component of total costs. Additional costs include:

1. **Test Data Generation**
   - Annexes VII, VIII, IX require extensive toxicological and ecotoxicological testing
   - Costs typically range from £50,000 to £250,000+ depending on:
     - What data is already available
     - Whether you can join an existing consortium
     - Need for new animal testing vs. existing data

2. **Consortium Participation** (if available)
   - Joining an existing substance consortium can significantly reduce costs
   - Shares data generation costs among multiple registrants
   - Consortium fees typically £5,000-£30,000+ depending on tonnage and timing

3. **Regulatory Consulting**
   - Assistance with dossier preparation, IUCLID software, CSA/CSR
   - Typically £15,000-£50,000 depending on complexity

4. **Only Representative (if applicable)**
   - If you're not GB-based, annual OR fees typically £3,000-£10,000/year

**Total Estimated Cost Range: £70,000 - £350,000+**

The wide range depends heavily on:
- Data availability and sharing opportunities
- Consortium participation
- Whether new testing is required
- Complexity of uses and exposure scenarios

## Enforcement and Penalties

### Criminal Offenses

Under REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008:
- Breach of Article 5 ("no data, no market") is a **criminal offense**
- Failing to register before importing is illegal
- Providing false/misleading information is an offense
- Obstructing HSE inspectors is an offense

### Penalties

- **Magistrates Court:** Up to £5,000 fine and/or up to 3 months imprisonment
- **Crown Court:** Significantly higher penalties for serious cases
- **No "due diligence" defense:** Being unaware of REACH is not an excuse

### Enforcement Approach

- HSE is the enforcement authority
- Can issue enforcement notices requiring behavior change
- Can prosecute for serious/repeated violations
- Enforcement decisions made case-by-case
- Primary focus on ensuring compliance rather than punishment

## Urea-Specific Information

### Substance Identity
- **Common Name:** Urea
- **CAS Number:** 57-13-6
- **EC Number:** 200-315-5
- **Molecular Formula:** CH₄N₂O
- **Common Uses:** Fertilizer, industrial applications, plastics manufacturing, animal feed

### EU REACH Status
- Urea is registered under EU REACH (registrations visible in ECHA database)
- Multiple registrants hold EU REACH registrations
- High-volume substance with established safety data

### UK REACH Status
- Did not find specific confirmation of UK REACH consortium for Urea
- Given high volume and common use, likely that UK registrations exist or are in progress
- **This needs further investigation** - check HSE UK REACH database or contact potential consortiums

## Key Questions to Determine Next Steps

To assess your compliance status and required actions, we need answers to:

1. **Current Legal Status:**
   - Are you GB-based or located outside GB?
   - Do you import directly from outside GB, or buy from GB suppliers?
   - Do you have a GB-based Only Representative?

2. **Historical EU REACH Status:**
   - Did you (or your entity) hold an EU REACH registration as a GB company before Brexit?
   - Did you submit a grandfathering notification to HSE?

3. **DUIN Status:**
   - Were you importing from EU suppliers with EU REACH registrations?
   - Did you submit a Downstream User Import Notification (DUIN) to HSE?

4. **Current Registration Status:**
   - Do you have any existing UK REACH registration for Urea?
   - Are you aware of your current registration reference numbers or submission dates?

5. **Supply Chain:**
   - Who is your supplier of Urea (GB, EU, or other)?
   - Does your supplier have UK REACH registration?
   - Are you the importer of record, or is Urea imported by your supplier?

---

## Immediate Recommendations

**URGENT - Before next import:**

1. **Verify current compliance status** - Determine which category you fall into (grandfathered, DUIN, registered, or non-compliant)
2. **If non-compliant:** STOP importing immediately until compliance is established
3. **Contact HSE** - Call the HSE UK REACH helpline to verify your status: ukreach@hse.gov.uk
4. **Review supply chain** - Confirm whether you are the legal importer or if your supplier handles imports
5. **Consider legal advice** - Given potential criminal liability, professional regulatory legal advice is strongly recommended

**Next Steps (if compliant with deferred deadline):**

1. Investigate Urea consortium membership opportunities
2. Begin gathering existing data on Urea
3. Engage regulatory consultants to prepare for Oct 2028 deadline
4. Budget for registration costs (£70k-£350k range)
