# HVO UK REACH Consortium Registration - Action Plan

## Why Registration is Required

1. **DUIN is Substance-Specific**: Your existing DUIN for Urea provides NO coverage for HVO. DUIN status is per substance, not per company.

2. **HVO Already Registered**: HVO is already registered under UK REACH with registration number **UK-01-9638319484-0-XXXX**. An existing consortium holds this registration.

3. **No Grace Period**: New substances require registration BEFORE importing. There is no grace or deferment period for substances not covered by an existing DUIN.

**Conclusion**: You must join the existing HVO consortium and obtain registration before you can legally import HVO into the UK.

## Action Steps

### Step 1: Submit Article 26 Enquiry (Can do yourself)

**Purpose**: Request contact details of existing HVO registrants from HSE

**Process**:
- Create account on <a href="https://www.comply-with-uk-reach.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Comply with UK REACH portal</a>
- Navigate to "Submit an Enquiry" → "Article 26 Enquiry"
- Provide substance details (HVO, CAS 68334-30-5)
- State your intended import volume and use
- HSE will provide contact details of Lead Registrant(s)

**Timeline**: HSE typically responds within 15 working days

**Cost**: Free

### Step 2: Contact Lead Registrant (May need consultant)

**Actions**:
- Contact Lead Registrant using details from Article 26 response
- Express interest in joining consortium
- Request Letter of Access (LoA) to registration data
- Negotiate consortium membership terms and fees

**Considerations**:
- Consortium fees vary by tonnage band (10-100 tonnes/year: typically £2,000-£10,000)
- Letter of Access costs depend on data sharing arrangements
- May require legal review of consortium agreements

---

### Step 3: Submit Joint Submission (Likely need consultant)

**Requirements**:
- Complete IUCLID 6 Cloud dossier as consortium member
- Include Letter of Access references to shared data
- Submit through Comply with UK REACH portal
- Pay HSE registration fee (£399 Small SME rate)

**Complexity**: High - consortium submissions require:
- IUCLID 6 technical expertise
- Understanding of data sharing requirements
- Coordination with Lead Registrant
- Compliance with REACH technical documentation standards

**Recommendation**: Engage REACH consultant for Steps 2-3
