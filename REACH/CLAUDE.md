# REACH Project - Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

This project contains research and compliance guidance for UK REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) legislation requirements for a small business importing Urea into the UK.

**Business Context:**
- Substance: Urea (CAS 57-13-6)
- Import volume: >100 tonnes per year
- Current status: Currently importing
- Primary goal: Compliance assessment

## Project Objectives

1. **Compliance Assessment**: Determine current compliance status and identify any gaps
2. **Cost Analysis**: Provide realistic estimates for registration and ongoing compliance
3. **Documentation**: Create templates and guidance documents for maintaining compliance

## Key Deliverables

- Summary compliance assessment report
- Cost estimates for registration and ongoing compliance
- Template documents for required record-keeping

## Research Priorities

1. UK REACH registration requirements for substances >100 tonnes/year
2. Transitional arrangements from EU REACH to UK REACH
3. Specific requirements for Urea (existing registrations, data requirements)
4. Importer obligations vs. manufacturer obligations
5. Only Representative (OR) requirements if applicable
6. Downstream user obligations
7. Costs: registration fees, data costs, consortium fees, legal/consulting costs

## Important Considerations

### UK REACH vs EU REACH
- Post-Brexit, UK REACH is separate from EU REACH
- Previous EU REACH registrations do not automatically carry over
- Transitional provisions may apply depending on import history

### Urea-Specific Context
- Urea is a high-volume chemical with existing registrations
- May be covered by consortium arrangements
- Multiple uses (fertilizer, industrial applications) affect classification

### Compliance Urgency
- Business is currently importing - compliance status is critical
- Non-compliance can result in inability to import legally
- Fines and penalties may apply for non-compliance

## Research Approach

1. **Verify Current Regulations**: Use official UK HSE and ECHA sources
2. **Check Substance Status**: Determine if Urea is already registered in UK REACH
3. **Identify Obligations**: Clarify whether business needs full registration or can use alternatives
4. **Calculate Costs**: Provide realistic budget estimates
5. **Create Actionable Guidance**: Provide clear next steps

## Information Sources

Primary sources to prioritize:
- UK HSE (Health and Safety Executive) - UK REACH authority
- ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) - for background and EU REACH context
- UK REACH legislation (The REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations)
- Official guidance documents on transitional arrangements

## Communication Guidelines

- Use clear, business-friendly language alongside technical/legal terms
- Highlight urgent actions vs. longer-term requirements
- Provide realistic timelines and cost ranges
- Flag areas where professional legal/regulatory advice is strongly recommended
- Be specific about what the business needs to do vs. what suppliers should handle

## Document Organization

Research and findings should be organized into:
- `/research/` - Background research, regulation summaries, technical details
- `/reports/` - Summary reports and compliance assessments
- `/templates/` - Template documents for compliance records
- `/costs/` - Cost breakdowns and estimates
