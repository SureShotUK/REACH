## Email Draft

**Subject:** Late DUIN Submission Inquiry - Urea (CAS 57-13-6)

Dear HSE UK REACH Team,

We are writing to inquire about submitting a late Downstream User Import Notification (DUIN) for Urea imports into Great Britain.

### Company Information

**Company Name:** [Your Company Name]
**Company Registration Number:** [Your Companies House Number]
**Address:** [Your GB Address]
**Contact Person:** [Your Name]
**Email:** [Your Email]
**Phone:** [Your Phone Number]

### Substance Information

**Substance Name:** Urea (also known as Carbamide)
**CAS Number:** 57-13-6
**EC Number:** 200-315-5
**Current Annual Import Volume:** [X] tonnes per year (100-1000 tonnes/year tonnage band)

### Historical Import Status (2019-2020)

We were importing Urea from European Union suppliers during the eligibility period for DUIN:

- **First import date:** March 31, 2019
- **Import pattern:** Regular, ongoing imports throughout 2019 and 2020
- **Supplier locations:** [List EU countries - e.g., "Germany, Netherlands"]
- **Import volumes during 2019-2020:** Over 100 tonnes per year
- **Status under EU REACH:** We were downstream users purchasing from EU suppliers who held valid EU REACH registrations

### Current Situation

We did not submit a DUIN by the original deadline of October 27, 2021. We have since become aware of our UK REACH obligations and understand from HSE guidance (www.hse.gov.uk/reach/duin.htm) that late DUIN submissions are still accepted for eligible companies.

### Our Questions

We would be grateful if you could confirm the following:

1. **Eligibility Confirmation:** Based on our import history described above, can you confirm that we are eligible to submit a late DUIN for Urea?

2. **Submission Process:** What is the current process for submitting a late DUIN? Should we use the UK REACH IT system, or is there a different procedure for late submissions?

3. **Documentation Requirements:** What documentation should we provide to support our late DUIN submission? We have:
   - Import records from 2019-2020 (shipping documents, invoices)
   - Supplier information showing EU locations
   - Evidence of ongoing imports since 2019

4. **Registration Deadline:** If our late DUIN is accepted, will we receive the extended registration deadline of October 27, 2028 for the 100-1000 tonnes/year tonnage band under The REACH (Amendment) Regulations 2023?

5. **Interim Import Status:** Can we continue importing Urea while our late DUIN submission is being processed by HSE?

6. **Consortium Information:** Can HSE provide any guidance on whether UK REACH consortiums exist for Urea (CAS 57-13-6), or suggest how we might connect with other registrants for data-sharing purposes under Article 11 of UK REACH?

### Our Commitment to Compliance

We wish to emphasize our commitment to full compliance with UK REACH. Our failure to submit a DUIN by the original deadline was not intentional, but resulted from insufficient understanding of the post-Brexit regulatory changes. We are now taking immediate action to ensure compliance and would appreciate HSE's guidance on the correct procedure.

We are prepared to submit our late DUIN immediately upon receiving confirmation of the process and any specific requirements.

### Preferred Contact Method

Please respond to this email, or contact me by phone at [Your Phone Number] if you require any additional information.

Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to your guidance.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
