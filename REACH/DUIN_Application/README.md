# DUIN Application Folder - README

**Purpose:** Complete documentation package for late DUIN submission to HSE
**Substance:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6, EC 200-315-5)
**Status:** Eligible for late DUIN based on March 31, 2019 first import from EU supplier
**Target Deadline with DUIN:** October 27, 2028

---

## Critical Discovery

**You are eligible for late DUIN submission** based on:
- ✓ First import: March 31, 2019 (from EU supplier)
- ✓ Continued regular imports throughout 2019-2020
- ✓ Import volume >100 tonnes per year
- ✓ Status: Downstream user under EU REACH (not importer)

This changes your compliance situation from **"immediate criminal offense"** to **"deferred registration deadline until October 2028"**.

---

## What is DUIN?

**DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)** is a mechanism under Article 127E of UK REACH that allows companies who were downstream users under EU REACH during 2019-2020 to defer their UK REACH registration obligations until 2026-2030 (depending on tonnage band).

**Your situation:**
- Before Brexit: You purchased Urea from EU suppliers = downstream user (no registration needed)
- After Brexit: Purchasing from EU to GB = importing (registration required)
- DUIN solution: Acknowledge new importer status, receive extended deadline

**With DUIN:** Registration deadline = **October 27, 2028** (2 years 11 months from now)
**Without DUIN:** Currently operating illegally

## FAQ

**Q: How much does DUIN submission cost?**
A: DUIN submission is **free** - there is no fee to submit a DUIN notification.

**Q: Can I continue importing while DUIN is being processed?**
A: Yes, once submitted, you are operating under the deferred registration framework. However, get written confirmation from HSE to be safe.

**Q: What if HSE rejects my late DUIN?**
A: Based on your import history (March 31, 2019 first import from EU, continued through 2019-2020), rejection is unlikely. You clearly meet eligibility criteria. If HSE requests additional evidence, provide it promptly.

**Q: What happens after DUIN is accepted?**
A: You have until October 27, 2028 to complete full UK REACH registration. Follow the roadmap in `Post_DUIN_Registration_Pathway.md`.

**Q: What if I miss the October 27, 2028 registration deadline?**
A: It will be illegal to import Urea into GB. This is a criminal offense with penalties up to unlimited fines and 2 years imprisonment in Crown Court. **Do not miss this deadline.**

**Q: How much will full registration cost?**
A: If you join a consortium: £26,000-£74,000. If individual registration: £90,000-£402,000. Consortium is strongly recommended.

**Q: What if I can't find 2019-2020 import documents?**
A: Use the reconstruction strategies in `Historical_Evidence_Documentation.md`:
- Request copies from suppliers
- Check accounting/ERP systems
- Review bank statements
- Contact freight forwarders
- Prepare statutory declaration if necessary

**Q: Do I need a lawyer?**
A: Recommended but not required for DUIN submission (straightforward process). However, engage legal counsel for:
- Review of consortium agreements
- Regulatory compliance oversight
- Contract review with REACH consultants

## Success Criteria

You will know you've succeeded when:

1. ✓ HSE confirms receipt and acceptance of your late DUIN

## Why This Matters

**Without DUIN:**

- Business impact: Cannot legally import, business disruption
- Action required: Stop importing immediately

**With DUIN:**
- Current status: Legally compliant under deferred deadline
- Risk: Minimal (as long as registration completed by October 2028)
- Business impact: Normal operations, plan for registration over 3 years
- Action required: Submit DUIN now, prepare for registration 2026-2028

**The March 31, 2019 import date is the key fact that changes everything.**
