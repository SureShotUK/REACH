**Mitigation:**
- **Target internal deadline:** September 1, 2028 (8 weeks buffer)
- **Consultant contract includes deadline guarantee clause**
- **Monthly progress reviews with consultant**
- **Escalation process if project falls behind schedule**
- **Contingency budget for expedited services if needed**

### Risk: Consortium Delays or Failure

**Mitigation:**
- Join established consortium with proven track record
- Include timeline commitments in consortium agreement
- Monitor consortium progress quarterly
- Have "Plan B" (individual registration) consultant on standby
- Allocate contingency budget for individual registration if consortium fails

### Risk: Data Gaps or HSE Rejection

**Mitigation:**
- Engage experienced consultant with UK REACH submission history
- Conduct internal peer review before submission
- Use IUCLID validation tools rigorously
- Submit 1 month before deadline (time for corrections)
- Ensure data sharing agreements cover all required endpoints
