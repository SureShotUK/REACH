**Your Status (2019-2020):**
- GB-based company ✓
- Purchasing from EU suppliers ✓
- Intra-EU trade (not "import" under EU REACH) ✓

## Section 7: Legal Declarations

### Statutory Declaration Template (if needed)

If original documentation is incomplete, a statutory declaration may support your DUIN:

**STATUTORY DECLARATION**

I, [Full Name], of [Address], [Job Title] at [Company Name], do solemnly and sincerely declare that:

1. I am authorized to make this declaration on behalf of [Company Name] (Company Registration Number: _________).

2. [Company Name] was importing Urea (CAS 57-13-6, EC 200-315-5) from European Union suppliers during the period of 2019-2020.

3. Our first import of Urea from an EU supplier occurred on March 31, 2019, from [Supplier Name] in [EU Country].

4. We continued to import Urea regularly throughout 2019 and 2020, with annual volumes exceeding 100 tonnes per year.

5. During this period (2019-2020), we were downstream users as defined by Article 3(13) of EU REACH, purchasing from EU suppliers who held valid EU REACH registrations.

6. We were not required to register Urea under EU REACH because we were downstream users, not importers, as the movement of goods from other EU member states to the UK was intra-EU trade.

7. Following Brexit on January 1, 2021, we understand that our status changed from downstream user to importer under UK REACH.

8. We did not submit a Downstream User Import Notification (DUIN) by the October 27, 2021 deadline, but wish to submit a late DUIN now.

9. I make this declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and correct.

Declared at [Location] this [Day] day of [Month], 2025.
