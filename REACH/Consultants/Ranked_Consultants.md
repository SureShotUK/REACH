# UK REACH Registration Consultants - Ranked Assessment

**Project Context:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6) import registration, >1000 tonnes/year
**Assessment Date:** November 7, 2025
**Total Consultants Reviewed:** 50 URLs

## ⚠️ CRITICAL URGENT NOTICE

**REGISTRATION DEADLINE:** The UK REACH registration deadline for substances imported at 1000+ tonnes/year is **27th October 2026**.

**Time Remaining:** Approximately 11 months to achieve compliance.

**Current Status:** Without UK REACH registration, continued imports beyond the deadline will be **ILLEGAL** and constitute a **criminal offense** under Regulation 11 of SI 2008/2852.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. **Begin registration process immediately** - 12-24 month timeline required
2. **Contact consultants NOW** for registration support
3. **Assess fastest compliance pathway** (own registration vs. Only Representative vs. GB supplier switch)
4. **Consider immediate switch to GB supplier** as fastest and most cost-effective path to compliance

Time is critical. Registration processes typically take 12-24 months, leaving limited margin before the deadline.

3. **Ecomundo** - For specialized, cost-optimized option

**In your quote request, specify:**
- Substance: Urea (CAS 57-13-6)

### What to Ask in Initial Consultations

1. **Experience Questions:**

   - "How many UK REACH registrations have you completed above 1000 tonnes/year?"
   - "Can you provide case studies or references?"

2. **Service Questions:**
   - "Do you offer Only Representative services?"
   - "Is there an existing Urea consortium we could join?"
   - "Do you conduct testing in-house or subcontract?"

   - "Can you meet the 27th October 2026 deadline?"

3. **Cost Questions:**
   - "What is your total estimated cost (registration fees + testing + consulting)?"

## COST EXPECTATIONS

Based on research and industry knowledge:

### Tier 1 Consultants (SGS, Intertek, TUV SUD, Bureau Veritas, Element)
- **Total Cost Estimate:** £100,000 - £250,000
- **Breakdown:**
  - UK REACH registration fee (HSE): £6,000 - £30,000 (tonnage dependent)
  - Testing (if needed): £30,000 - £120,000
  - Consulting/preparation: £40,000 - £80,000
  - Ongoing annual: £5,000 - £15,000

### Tier 2 Consultants (Ecomundo, CIRS, Ramboll, Chementors, ChemService, CS Regulatory)
- **Total Cost Estimate:** £60,000 - £150,000
- **Breakdown:**
  - UK REACH registration fee: £6,000 - £30,000
  - Testing (if needed): £20,000 - £80,000
  - Consulting/preparation: £25,000 - £50,000
  - Ongoing annual: £3,000 - £10,000

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Join existing Urea consortium** - Share data costs with other registrants
2. **Use Only Representative** - Let supplier handle registration, you pay access fee
3. **Switch to GB supplier** - Become downstream user, avoid registration entirely (£0)
4. **Maximize existing data** - Use ECHA/HSE databases to minimize testing needs
5. **Data waivers** - Justify why certain tests not needed (QSAR, read-across)

**IMPORTANT:** The most cost-effective solution remains **switching to a GB-based supplier** who already holds UK REACH registration. This makes you a downstream user with minimal ongoing obligations and £0 registration costs.

- [ ] Assess supply chain impact of switching suppliers

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDER

**Before committing to expensive UK REACH registration:**

You must achieve compliance before **27th October 2026** to continue legally importing Urea from outside GB.

**Three paths forward:**

1. **FASTEST & CHEAPEST:** Switch to GB supplier (2-8 weeks, £4k-£11k transition)
2. **MODERATE:** Arrange Only Representative with current supplier (6-12 months, £20k-£60k)
3. **SLOWEST & MOST EXPENSIVE:** Obtain your own registration (12-24 months, £60k-£250k+)

**Legal Compliance After Deadline:**
- Imports without registration after 27th October 2026 will violate Article 5 of UK REACH
- Criminal offense under Regulation 11 of SI 2008/2852
- Penalties: Up to 2 years imprisonment and/or unlimited fine
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Achieve compliance before deadline (11 months remaining)
