# UK REACH Compliance - One-Page Summary

**Substance:** Urea (CAS 57-13-6) | **Import Volume:** >1000 tonnes/year | **Deadline:** October 27, 2026

---

## 1. Penalties for Non-Compliance

**Criminal offense under REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008:**
- **Crown Court:** Unlimited fines + up to 2 years imprisonment
- **Magistrates Court:** Up to £5,000 fine + 3 months imprisonment
- **Personal liability** for directors (Regulation 20)

- Additional consequences: Director disqualification, business closure, reputational damage

**Enforcement:** HSE can prosecute violations, issue enforcement notices, and seize non-compliant goods.

## 2. How UK REACH Registration Requirement Came About

**Brexit regulatory change (January 1, 2021):**

| Before Brexit | After Brexit |
|---------------|--------------|
| GB companies = "downstream users" under EU REACH | GB companies = "importers" under UK REACH |
| No registration needed | **Full registration required** |
| Covered by EU supplier's ECHA registration | Must register with HSE separately |

**Result:** EU REACH registrations became invalid for GB. Companies previously compliant as downstream users became non-compliant importers overnight, requiring UK REACH registration with HSE.

---

## 3. DUIN Explanation and Timeline

**DUIN (Downstream User Import Notification)** defers registration for companies that were downstream users under EU REACH before Brexit.

**Eligibility:** Must have been importing from EU suppliers with EU REACH registrations during 2019-2020 (pre-Brexit).

**Submission:** Late DUINs still accepted by HSE - submit immediately.

**Registration Deadline for >1000 t/year:** **October 27, 2026** (11 months from Nov 2025) - **URGENT**

**Without DUIN:** Immediate registration required. Importing without registration is a criminal offense.
